# Let's explain each method of the `Sort` class in detail, provide code examples, and summarize the information:

1. `by(String... properties)` method:
   ```java
   Sort sort = Sort.by("column1", "column2", "column3");
   ```
   Explanation:
   - This method allows you to pass multiple column names as varargs (`String...`) to specify the sorting criteria.
   - The columns will be sorted in ascending order by default.

2. `by(Direction direction, String... properties)` method:
   ```java
   Sort sort = Sort.by(Direction.DESC, "column1", "column2", "column3");
   ```
   Explanation:
   - This method allows you to pass multiple column names as varargs, along with a `Direction` enum value, to specify the sorting criteria.
   - The `Direction` enum has two values: `ASC` (ascending) and `DESC` (descending).
   - The provided columns will be sorted in the specified direction.

3. `by(Order... orders)` method:
   ```java
   Order order1 = Order.desc("column1");
   Order order2 = Order.asc("column2");
   Sort sort = Sort.by(order1, order2);
   ```
   Explanation:
   - This method allows you to pass multiple `Order` objects to specify the sorting criteria.
   - An `Order` object represents a combination of a property (column) and a sorting direction (ASC or DESC).
   - You can create `Order` objects using the `Order.asc()` or `Order.desc()` methods, specifying the column name and direction.
   - The provided `Order` objects define the sorting criteria for the query.

Conclusion:
The `Sort` class in Spring Boot Data JPA provides convenient static methods to define sorting criteria for query results. You can use the `by()` method with different combinations of parameters to specify columns, directions, and mixed order combinations.

By using the `Sort` class, you can easily create a `Sort` object that represents the desired sorting criteria. This object can then be passed to methods such as `findAll(Sort sort)` or `findAll(Pageable pageable)` in Spring Data JPA repositories to apply the sorting to the query results.

Using the `Sort` class provides a flexible and readable way to define sorting in your Spring Data JPA queries, making it easier to maintain and modify the sorting criteria as needed.

# Here's the code for each class separately, followed by their explanations, and then the code and explanation for the second class:

**1. Entity class: `Employee`**
```java
package com.app.Shivam.entity;

import javax.persistence.Column;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.Table;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Entity
@Table(name = "employee")
public class Employee {

    @Id
    @Column(name = "eid")
    private Integer empId;

    @Column(name = "ename")
    private String empName;

    @Column(name = "esal")
    private Double empSal;

    @Column(name = "edept")
    private String empDept;

}
```

Explanation:
- The `Employee` class is an entity class that represents the structure of the `employee` table in the database.
- It uses Lombok annotations (`@Data`, `@NoArgsConstructor`, `@AllArgsConstructor`) to generate getters, setters, constructors, and other common methods.
- The class is annotated with `@Entity` to indicate that it is an entity in the database, and the `@Table` annotation specifies the table name.

**2. Repository Interface: `EmployeeRepository`**
```java
package com.app.Shivam.repo;

import org.springframework.data.repository.PagingAndSortingRepository;

import com.app.Shivam.entity.Employee;

public interface EmployeeRepository extends PagingAndSortingRepository<Employee, Integer> {

}
```

Explanation:
- The `EmployeeRepository` interface extends the `PagingAndSortingRepository` interface provided by Spring Data JPA.
- It specifies the entity type (`Employee`) and the type of the entity's primary key (`Integer`).
- By extending `PagingAndSortingRepository`, the repository gains access to methods for basic CRUD operations, as well as sorting and pagination functionality.

**3. Runner class-1 for inserting data: `TestASaveRunner`**
```java
package com.app.Shivam.runner;

import java.util.Arrays;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.core.annotation.Order;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import com.app.Shivam.entity.Employee;
import com.app.Shivam.repo.EmployeeRepository;

@Component
@Order(10)
public class TestASaveRunner implements CommandLineRunner {

    @Autowired
    private EmployeeRepository repo;

    public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
        repo.saveAll(Arrays.asList(
                new Employee(10, "AAB", 200.0, "DEV"),
                new Employee(11, "AAB", 200.0, "QA"),
                new Employee(12, "AAB", 200.0, "BA"),
                new Employee(13, "AAB", 300.0, "DEV"),
                new Employee(14, "AAB", 300.0, "QA"),
                new Employee(15, "AAB", 300.0, "BA"),
                new Employee(16, "AAB", 400.0, "DEV"),
                new Employee(17, "AAB", 400.0, "QA"),
                new Employee(18, "AAB", 400.0, "BA")
        ));
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- The `TestASaveRunner` class is a command-line runner component that inserts data into the database.
- It is annotated with `@Component` to make it a Spring bean and `@Order(10)` to specify the execution order among multiple runners.
- In the `run()` method, the `EmployeeRepository` is used to save a list of `Employee` objects to the database

 using the `saveAll()` method.

**4. Runner class-2 to fetch data using sorting: `TestCFetchDataRunner`**
```java
package com.app.Shivam.runner;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.data.domain.Sort;
import org.springframework.data.domain.Sort.Direction;
import org.springframework.data.domain.Sort.Order;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import com.app.Shivam.repo.EmployeeRepository;

@Component
public class TestCFetchDataRunner implements CommandLineRunner {

    @Autowired
    private EmployeeRepository repo;

    public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
        // 1. select * from employee order by esal ASC
        // use static method by() present in Sort class.
        repo.findAll(Sort.by("empSal"))
                .forEach(System.out::println);

        // 2. select * from employee order by esal DESC
        // Use Direction property in by() method.
        // repo.findAll(Sort.by(Direction.ASC,"empSal"))
        repo.findAll(Sort.by(Direction.DESC, "empSal"))
                .forEach(System.out::println);

        // 3. select * from employee order by esal, dept ; //both ASC
        // 3. select * from employee order by esal DESC, dept DESC; //both DESC
        // repo.findAll(Sort.by("empSal","empDept"))
        repo.findAll(Sort.by(Direction.DESC, "empSal", "empDept"))
                .forEach(System.out::println);

        // 4. select * from employee order by esal ASC, dept DESC;
        repo.findAll(Sort.by(Order.asc("empSal"), Order.desc("empDept")))
                .forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- The `TestCFetchDataRunner` class is a command-line runner component that fetches data from the database using sorting.
- It is annotated with `@Component` to make it a Spring bean.
- In the `run()` method, various sorting scenarios are demonstrated using the `EmployeeRepository` and the `findAll()` method along with the `Sort.by()` method to define the sorting criteria.

**Conclusion:**
The provided code showcases a Spring Boot Data JPA application with sorting functionality. The entity class `Employee` represents the structure of the `employee` table, and the repository interface `EmployeeRepository` extends `PagingAndSortingRepository` to provide sorting capabilities.

The first runner class, `TestASaveRunner`, inserts data into the database using the `saveAll()` method. The second runner class, `TestCFetchDataRunner`, demonstrates different sorting scenarios using the `Sort.by()` method from the `Sort` class.

By utilizing Spring Data JPA's sorting features, you can easily sort query results in ascending or descending order based on one or multiple columns. This enhances the flexibility and readability of your data retrieval operations.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

# Here's the explanation for each point in the `TestCFetchDataRunner` class:

1. Sorting by a single column in ascending order:
```java
repo.findAll(Sort.by("empSal"))
    .forEach(System.out::println);
```
In this scenario, the `findAll()` method retrieves all records from the `Employee` table and sorts them by the `empSal` column in ascending order. The `Sort.by("empSal")` method creates a `Sort` object with the sorting criteria, and the resulting data is printed to the console.

2. Sorting by a single column in descending order:
```java
repo.findAll(Sort.by(Direction.DESC, "empSal"))
    .forEach(System.out::println);
```
This example demonstrates sorting by the `empSal` column in descending order. The `Sort.by(Direction.DESC, "empSal")` method creates a `Sort` object with the sorting direction (`DESC`) and the column name (`empSal`). The retrieved data is then printed to the console.

3. Sorting by multiple columns:
```java
repo.findAll(Sort.by(Direction.DESC, "empSal", "empDept"))
    .forEach(System.out::println);
```
Here, the data is sorted by multiple columns: `empSal` and `empDept`. Both columns are sorted in descending order because the `Direction.DESC` is specified. The resulting data is printed to the console.

4. Sorting by multiple columns with mixed ascending and descending order:
```java
repo.findAll(Sort.by(Order.asc("empSal"), Order.desc("empDept")))
    .forEach(System.out::println);
```
In this case, the `Sort.by(Order.asc("empSal"), Order.desc("empDept"))` method is used to sort by `empSal` in ascending order and `empDept` in descending order. The `Order.asc()` and `Order.desc()` methods are used to define the sorting order for each column. The retrieved data is printed to the console.

**Conclusion:**
The `TestCFetchDataRunner` class demonstrates various scenarios of fetching data from the `Employee` table with different sorting configurations. It utilizes the `Sort` class provided by Spring Data JPA to define the sorting criteria.

By using the `Sort.by()` method, you can easily specify the columns to sort by and the sorting direction (ascending or descending). You can sort by a single column or multiple columns with the flexibility to define the order for each column.

These sorting capabilities enhance the querying capabilities of your Spring Data JPA application, allowing you to retrieve data in the desired order based on your business requirements.

# Here's a detailed explanation of the concepts related to pagination using `Pageable` in Spring Data JPA:

1. Background:
   - When you use the `findAll()` method without pagination, it fetches all rows from the database table. This can be problematic when dealing with heavy or large data sets.
   - To address this, pagination allows you to retrieve data in smaller chunks or pages, improving performance and reducing the amount of data transferred.

2. `findAll(Pageable pageable)` Method:
   - The `findAll(Pageable pageable)` method is used to fetch data from the database using the pagination concept. It returns a `Page<T>` object, which contains the data and metadata about the page (e.g., isFirst, isLast, hasNext, etc.).
   - The `Pageable` interface represents the pagination information, including the page number and page size. It acts as an input parameter for the `findAll()` method.

3. `Pageable` Interface:
   - The `Pageable` interface defines the contract for pagination. It typically takes two inputs:
     - `pageNum`: The page number to retrieve.
     - `pageSize`: The number of records to fetch per page.
   - The `Pageable` interface is implemented by the `PageRequest` class, which provides a convenient way to create a `Pageable` object using the `of()` static method:
     ```java
     Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(pageNum, pageSize);
     ```

4. SQL Generation:
   - The underlying database dialect generates the appropriate SQL query based on the `Pageable` object.
   - For example, when using MySQL, the generated SQL query might look like:
     ```
     SELECT * FROM employee LIMIT rowIndex, maxRows;
     ```
     Here, `rowIndex` represents the starting row index, and `maxRows` represents the maximum number of rows to fetch.

5. Benefits of Pagination:
   - Pagination allows you to retrieve data in smaller chunks or pages, which is useful for handling large data sets.
   - It improves performance by reducing the amount of data transferred between the database and the client device.
   - Pagination provides metadata about the current page, such as whether it's the first or last page, whether there is a next page, etc.

**Conclusion:**
Pagination using `Pageable` in Spring Data JPA enables you to retrieve data in a controlled manner, fetching a specific number of records per page. By using the `findAll(Pageable pageable)` method and providing the desired page number and page size, you can efficiently manage large data sets and optimize performance. The generated SQL query is specific to the database dialect being used, allowing for seamless integration with different database systems.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

```java
    //1. Entity, Repository, Test Runner-1 are same as above
    //2. Test Runner to fetch data based on pagination

    package com.app.Shivam.runner;

    import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
    import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
    import org.springframework.data.domain.Page;
    import org.springframework.data.domain.PageRequest;
    import org.springframework.data.domain.Pageable;
    import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

    import com.app.Shivam.entity.Employee;
    import com.app.Shivam.repo.EmployeeRepository;

    @Component
    public class TestDFetchPagRunner implements CommandLineRunner {
        
        @Autowired
        private EmployeeRepository repo;
        
        public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
            //repo.findAll().forEach(System.out::println);
            
            //inpput
            Pageable p = PageRequest.of(44, 4);
            
            //output
            Page<Employee> page = repo.findAll(p);
            
            //result
            page.getContent()//List<T>
            .forEach(System.out::println);
            
            //metadata
            System.out.println(page.isFirst());
            System.out.println(page.isLast());
            System.out.println(page.isEmpty());
            System.out.println(page.hasNext());
            System.out.println(page.hasPrevious());
            System.out.println(page.getTotalPages());
            System.out.println(page.getTotalElements());
            System.out.println(page.getSize());
            System.out.println(page.hasContent());
        }

    }
```

Certainly! Here's a detailed explanation of the example code provided:

1. Entity, Repository, and Test Runner-1:
   - The `Entity` class (`Employee`), `Repository` interface (`EmployeeRepository`), and `TestASaveRunner` remain the same as mentioned in the previous example. These components are responsible for defining the entity structure, repository methods, and inserting data into the database.

2. Test Runner to Fetch Data Based on Pagination:
   - The `TestDFetchPagRunner` class is a command-line runner component responsible for fetching data using pagination.
   - It is annotated with `@Component` to mark it as a Spring component for auto-detection during the application startup.
   - The class implements the `CommandLineRunner` interface, which means the `run()` method will be executed when the application starts.

3. `run()` Method Explanation:
   - Inside the `run()` method, we perform the following steps:
     - Create a `Pageable` object (`p`) using `PageRequest.of(pageNum, pageSize)`. In this example, we use `44` as the page number and `4` as the page size.
     - Call the `findAll(p)` method on the `EmployeeRepository` to retrieve a `Page<Employee>` object (`page`) containing the data and metadata based on the provided `Pageable`.
     - Use `page.getContent()` to retrieve the list of entities (`List<Employee>`) present on the current page and print them using `System.out.println`.
     - Access the metadata of the page using various methods provided by the `Page` interface. These methods include:
       - `isFirst()`: Checks if the current page is the first page.
       - `isLast()`: Checks if the current page is the last page.
       - `isEmpty()`: Checks if the current page is empty.
       - `hasNext()`: Checks if there is a next page available.
       - `hasPrevious()`: Checks if there is a previous page available.
       - `getTotalPages()`: Retrieves the total number of pages.
       - `getTotalElements()`: Retrieves the total number of elements across all pages.
       - `getSize()`: Retrieves the current page size.
       - `hasContent()`: Checks if the current page has any content.

**Conclusion:**
The `TestDFetchPagRunner` class demonstrates fetching data using pagination in Spring Data JPA. By creating a `Pageable` object and providing the desired page number and page size, you can retrieve a specific page of data from the database. The resulting `Page<Employee>` object contains the data and metadata related to the current page, allowing for efficient handling and presentation of large data sets.

# Here are some frequently asked questions related to the code examples and their corresponding answers:

**Q1: What is the purpose of pagination in database queries?**<br/>
A1: Pagination is used to divide large result sets into smaller, more manageable chunks called pages. It allows for efficient retrieval and presentation of data, particularly when dealing with large data sets. Pagination helps improve performance by reducing the amount of data transferred over the network and improving the user experience by displaying data in smaller, digestible portions.

**Q2: How does pagination work in Spring Data JPA?**<br/>
A2: Spring Data JPA provides built-in support for pagination through the `Pageable` interface. By specifying the desired page number and page size using `PageRequest.of(pageNum, pageSize)`, you can retrieve a specific page of data from the database. The `findAll(Pageable pageable)` method returns a `Page<T>` object containing the data and metadata for the requested page.

**Q3: What is the difference between `Page` and `List` in Spring Data JPA?**<br/>
A3: `List` represents a collection of entities fetched from the database without any pagination. It contains all the entities returned by the query. On the other hand, `Page` represents a single page of entities along with metadata. It provides methods to access information about the current page, such as the total number of pages, the total number of elements, and whether there are more pages available.

**Q4: How can I access the data and metadata from a `Page` object in Spring Data JPA?**<br/>
A4: You can access the data (a list of entities) present on the current page using the `getContent()` method of the `Page` interface. Metadata about the page can be retrieved using various methods provided by the `Page` interface, such as `isFirst()`, `isLast()`, `getTotalPages()`, `getTotalElements()`, and more.

**Q5: What is the purpose of the `Pageable` interface in Spring Data JPA?**<br/>
A5: The `Pageable` interface represents the abstraction for pagination information. It allows you to define the page number and page size for retrieving a specific subset of data from the database. Spring Data JPA provides an implementation of the `Pageable` interface called `PageRequest`, which can be created using the `PageRequest.of(pageNum, pageSize)` method.

**Q6: How can I customize the sorting while using pagination in Spring Data JPA?**<br/>
A6: Along with the `Pageable` parameter, you can specify the sorting order by using the overloaded `findAll(Pageable pageable)` method. You can create a `Pageable` object with sorting information using `PageRequest.of(pageNum, pageSize, Sort sort)`, where `Sort` represents the sorting criteria (e.g., `Sort.by("column1").ascending().and(Sort.by("column2").descending())`).

**Q7: Can I change the default sort order for a specific column while using pagination in Spring Data JPA?**<br/>
A7: Yes, you can change the default sort order by specifying the desired direction (ascending or descending) for a specific column in the `Sort` object. For example, `Sort.by(Direction.DESC, "column1")` will sort the data in descending order based on "column1".

**Q8: How can I handle an empty page (no data returned) in Spring Data JPA pagination?**<br/>
A8: The `Page` interface provides the `isEmpty()` method to check if the current page is empty, meaning no data is returned. You can use this method to handle scenarios where the requested page does not contain any data and display an appropriate message or take necessary actions.

# Here are some typical questions related to `PaginationAndSortingRepository` in Spring Data JPA along with their answers:

**Q1: What is `PaginationAndSortingRepository` in Spring Data JPA?**<br/>
A1: `PaginationAndSortingRepository` is an interface provided by Spring Data JPA that extends the `CrudRepository` interface. It includes additional methods for performing pagination and sorting operations on entities. It provides convenient methods like `findAll(Pageable pageable)` and `findAll(Sort sort)` to retrieve data with pagination and sorting capabilities.

**Q2: How do you perform pagination using `PaginationAndSortingRepository`?**<br/>
A2: To perform pagination using `PaginationAndSortingRepository`, you can use the `findAll(Pageable pageable)` method. Create a `Pageable` object using `PageRequest.of(pageNumber, pageSize)`, specifying the desired page number and page size. Pass this `Pageable` object to the `findAll()` method, and it will return a `Page` object containing the data and metadata for the requested page.

**Q3: How can you specify the sorting order when using `PaginationAndSortingRepository`?**<br/>
A3: You can specify the sorting order by using the `findAll(Sort sort)` method provided by `PaginationAndSortingRepository`. Create a `Sort` object with the desired sorting criteria, such as `Sort.by("columnName")` for ascending order or `Sort.by(Direction.DESC, "columnName")` for descending order. Pass this `Sort` object to the `findAll()` method to retrieve the data in the specified sorting order.

**Q4: Can you apply both pagination and sorting together using `PaginationAndSortingRepository`?**<br/>
A4: Yes, you can apply both pagination and sorting together using `PaginationAndSortingRepository`. You can use the `findAll(Pageable pageable)` method and pass a `Pageable` object that includes both the page number, page size, and sorting criteria. Create a `Pageable` object using `PageRequest.of(pageNumber, pageSize, Sort sort)`, where you specify the desired sorting order. The returned `Page` object will contain the data for the requested page in the specified sorting order.

**Q5: How does the pagination mechanism work internally in `PaginationAndSortingRepository`?**<br/>
A5: Internally, the pagination mechanism in `PaginationAndSortingRepository` generates the appropriate SQL query based on the `Pageable` object provided. It includes the necessary SQL clauses, such as `LIMIT` or `TOP`, to fetch only the required subset of data from the database based on the specified page number and page size. The data is then returned as a `Page` object, which contains the requested data and metadata.

**Q6: What are some methods provided by `PaginationAndSortingRepository` for pagination and sorting?**<br/>
A6: Some of the methods provided by `PaginationAndSortingRepository` for pagination and sorting are:
- `findAll(Pageable pageable)`: Retrieves a specific page of data based on the `Pageable` object.
- `findAll(Sort sort)`: Retrieves all data from the repository and applies the specified sorting order.
- `findAll(Pageable pageable, Sort sort)`: Retrieves a specific page of data with the specified sorting order.

**Q7: How can you check if there are more pages available when using `PaginationAndSortingRepository`?**<br/>
A7: You can check if there are more pages available by using the `hasNext()` method provided by the `Page` object returned by the `findAll(Pageable pageable)` method. If `hasNext()` returns `true`, it indicates that there are more pages available after the current page.

**Q8: How can you customize the page size when using `PaginationAndSortingRepository` ?**<br/>
A8: To customize the page size when using `PaginationAndSortingRepository`, you can pass the desired page size as a parameter to `PageRequest.of(pageNumber, pageSize)`. This allows you to control the number of entities fetched per page.

**Q9: Can you retrieve the total number of pages and total number of entities using `PaginationAndSortingRepository`?**<br/>
A9: Yes, you can retrieve the total number of pages and total number of entities using the `getTotalPages()` and `getTotalElements()` methods provided by the `Page` object returned by the `findAll(Pageable pageable)` method. `getTotalPages()` returns the total number of pages, and `getTotalElements()` returns the total number of entities across all pages.

**Q10: How do you handle empty pages when using `PaginationAndSortingRepository`?** <br/>
A10: When using `PaginationAndSortingRepository`, empty pages are handled by returning an empty `Page` object. You can check if a page is empty by using the `isEmpty()` method provided by the `Page` object. If `isEmpty()` returns `true`, it indicates that the requested page does not contain any entities.

These are some common questions related to `PaginationAndSortingRepository` in Spring Data JPA. It's essential to have a solid understanding of these concepts and practice implementing them to perform well in interviews or when working with pagination and sorting operations in Spring Data JPA.
