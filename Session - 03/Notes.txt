		Chapter - 1 : Spring Core
*) DI v/s IoC:-
Dependency Injection v/s Inversion of Control (Spring Container)

*) Dependency : A variable (instance variable) exist inside a class
		(Spring Bean)
=> Types of Dependencies: (3)
1. Primitive Type Dependency (PTD) [8+1]
byte, short, int , long, float, double, boolean, char and String
If a variable is created using one of above datatype then it is called as PTD.

2. Collection Type Dependency (CTD) [4]  (java.util)
If a variable is created using one of below types
	List, Set, Map [I] and Properties (C)
 then it is called as CTD.

3. Reference Type Dependency (RTD) ****
 A class or interface is used as a DataType and variable is created then it is called as RTD.

========================================================

Injection(4) : Providing data to variables (after object creation)

1. Setter Injection (SI):
   Provide/inject value to dependency using setter/set method.

   ** Object is created using default constructor and data is provided using set method.

    class A{
      int id;
      void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
      }
    }
    A  oa = new A();
    oa.setId(10);

===================================
2. Constructor Injection (CI): Creating object and providing
	data using parameterized constructor.

class A{
  int id;
  A(int id) {
    this.id = id;
  }
}
A oa = new A(10);
========================================================
3. LookUp Method Injection (LMI)
4. Interface Injection (II)

=============================================================
OOPs --- Java
DI   --- Spring container ( Spring IoC )

Q) What is Dependency Injection ?
A) => Injecting all dependencies to its dependent class.

=> Creating objects from independent to next level dependent classes and link (inject) them.

=> Create objects and link them based on relation.

Q) How many types of Dependencies in Spring ? and What are they?
A) They are 3 types , PTD, CTD, RTD.

Q) What is Injection and How many types are there in Spring?
A) Injection : providing data to dependencies
   Total : 4 , Spring supports: 3 (SI/CI/LMI), 
   mostly used : 2 (SI/CI)
