## **To define multiple microservice applications with Spring Cloud, Zipkin, and Sleuth dependencies, you need to follow these steps:**

1. Add the required dependencies to each microservice's `pom.xml` file. For Zipkin and Sleuth, you need to include the following dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-sleuth</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

2. Additionally, you can add other Spring Cloud dependencies based on your specific requirements. For example:
   - **Admin Client**: If you want to use Spring Boot Admin for monitoring and managing your microservices, you can include the following dependency:
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>de.codecentric</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-boot-admin-starter-client</artifactId>
   </dependency>
   ```
   This allows your microservices to register with the Spring Boot Admin Server.

   - **Eureka Discovery Client**: If you are using Netflix Eureka for service discovery and registration, you can include the following dependency:
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
   </dependency>
   ```
   This enables your microservices to register with the Eureka Server.

   - **Config Client**: If you are using Spring Cloud Config to externalize the configuration of your microservices, you can include the following dependency:
   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-config</artifactId>
   </dependency>
   ```
   This allows your microservices to retrieve configuration from the Config Server.

3. Configure each microservice's properties file (`application.properties` or `application.yml`) to enable the necessary features. For example:
   - For Sleuth and Zipkin:
   ```yaml
   spring.zipkin.base-url=http://zipkin-server:9411/
   ```

   - For Eureka Discovery Client:
   ```yaml
   spring.application.name=your-service-name
   spring.cloud.discovery.enabled=true
   spring.cloud.discovery.client.simple.instances.service1[0].uri=http://service1-host:service1-port
   spring.cloud.discovery.client.simple.instances.service2[0].uri=http://service2-host:service2-port
   ```

   - For Config Client:
   ```yaml
   spring.cloud.config.uri=http://config-server:8888
   ```

4. Implement the business logic in each microservice as per your requirements.

By following these steps, you can define multiple microservice applications with the necessary dependencies. Sleuth and Zipkin enable distributed tracing capabilities, while other Spring Cloud dependencies provide additional functionality such as service discovery (Eureka), centralized configuration (Config Server), and monitoring (Spring Boot Admin).

It's important to note that the exact configuration and dependencies may vary depending on your specific use case and the Spring Cloud version you are using. Make sure to refer to the official Spring Cloud documentation and examples for the most up-to-date information and configuration details.

# Code with Explanation

here is the code for the `AppConfig` class:

```java
package com.app.shivam.config;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
	
	@Bean
	public RestTemplate rt() {
		return new RestTemplate();
	}

}
```

Explanation:
- The `AppConfig` class is annotated with `@Configuration`, indicating that it provides bean definitions and configuration.
- Inside the class, the `rt()` method is annotated with `@Bean`. It creates and returns an instance of `RestTemplate`.
- `RestTemplate` is a class provided by Spring Framework for making HTTP requests. It is used to consume RESTful services.

Here is the code for the `ProcessARestController` class:

```java
package com.app.shivam.rest;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@RestController
public class ProcessARestController {
	
	private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ProcessARestController.class);

	@Autowired
	private RestTemplate rt;
	
	@GetMapping("/showA")
	public String showMsg() {
		log.info("WE ARE AT A SERVICE...");
		
		String resp = rt.getForEntity("http://localhost:8082/showB", String.class).getBody();
		
		return "FROM A.."+resp;
	}
}
```

Explanation:
- The `ProcessARestController` class is annotated with `@RestController`, indicating that it is a RESTful controller that handles HTTP requests.
- It injects an instance of `RestTemplate` using the `@Autowired` annotation. This is possible because we defined the `RestTemplate` bean in the `AppConfig` class.
- The `showMsg()` method is mapped to the `/showA` endpoint using `@GetMapping`. When this endpoint is accessed, the method is executed.
- Inside the method, a log message is printed using the SLF4J logging framework.
- The `RestTemplate` is used to make an HTTP GET request to the `http://localhost:8082/showB` endpoint and retrieve the response body.
- The method returns a string that combines the response from service B with the "FROM A.." prefix.

In conclusion, the `AppConfig` class provides a bean definition for `RestTemplate`, which is used by the `ProcessARestController` class to make an HTTP request to service B and retrieve its response. This code represents a simple example of communication between two services in a distributed system.

**To demonstrate the communication between multiple microservices (ServiceB and ServiceC) and the usage of Sleuth and Zipkin for distributed tracing, we'll provide the code examples and explain the concepts involved. Please find the code and explanations below.**

**ServiceB Application:**

```java
package com.app.shivam.serviceb;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@RestController
public class ServiceBController {

    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ServiceBController.class);

    @Autowired
    private RestTemplate restTemplate;

    @GetMapping("/showB")
    public String showMsg() {
        log.info("WE ARE AT B SERVICE...");

        String resp = restTemplate.getForEntity("http://localhost:8083/showC", String.class).getBody();

        return "FROM B.." + resp;
    }
}
```

**ServiceC Application:**

```java
package com.app.shivam.servicec;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@RestController
public class ServiceCController {

    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ServiceCController.class);

    @Autowired
    private RestTemplate restTemplate;

    @GetMapping("/showC")
    public String showMsg() {
        log.info("WE ARE AT C SERVICE...");

        return "FROM C";
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The code above demonstrates two additional microservices, ServiceB and ServiceC, similar to ServiceA from the previous example.
- ServiceB's `ServiceBController` class is responsible for handling HTTP requests and contains the `/showB` endpoint.
- In ServiceB's `showMsg()` method, a call is made to ServiceC's `/showC` endpoint using the `RestTemplate`.
- ServiceC's `ServiceCController` class handles requests for the `/showC` endpoint.
- The `RestTemplate` is used to make HTTP requests to ServiceC from ServiceB, similar to the communication between ServiceA and ServiceB.

**Sleuth and Zipkin:**

- Sleuth and Zipkin are used for distributed tracing in microservices.
- Sleuth generates tracing information, including TraceId, spanId, and parentId, for tracking requests across multiple microservices.
- TraceId represents the identifier for an entire request flow, while spanId represents the identifier for a specific microservice request flow.
- The parentId represents the spanId of the previous microservice in the request flow.
- By using Sleuth and Zipkin, the application logs will contain this tracing information, enabling tracing capabilities.
- The logs will have a format similar to: [ServiceName, TraceId, spanId, ExportFlag].

**Running the Applications and Checking Zipkin Server:**

- To run the applications, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies and configurations, including Sleuth and Zipkin.
- Start ServiceA, ServiceB, and ServiceC applications.
- Access the URL `http://localhost:8081/showA` in your browser to initiate the request flow.
- Each microservice will log its respective service name (A, B, C) in the console.
- Open the Zipkin Server UI (typically available at `http://localhost:9411/zipkin`) and click on "Trace" to view the traces recorded by Sleuth and Zipkin.
- You should be able to see the traces for the request flow involving ServiceA, ServiceB, and ServiceC, along with the timing information and dependencies between the microservices.

In conclusion, the provided code demonstrates the communication between multiple microservices (ServiceA, ServiceB, and ServiceC) and the usage of Sleuth and Zipkin for distributed tracing. By running the applications and checking the Zipkin Server, you can visualize and analyze the traces, including the execution path and timing information of the requests across the microservices.
