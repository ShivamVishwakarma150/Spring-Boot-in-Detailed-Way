P2P Communication : If one Message is sent to one Consumer
Destination type is : Queue.

Publish-Subscribe [Pub/Sub] Communication:
  if one Message is sent to multiple consumers. Destination type : Topic.

*) In Producer and Consumer applications we need to set one Property
   spring.jms.pub-sub-domain as true. Default is false.

=> false means P2P communication, true means Pub/sub.
=> Just define multiple consumers and set spring.jms.pub-sub-domain=true.
=> Cloned Copies of Actual Message is sent to multiple consumers.
=> Make Sure, all destination names (Producer and Consumer apps)
   must be matching.

Q) What if we delete topic from MQ Broker?
A) A new topic with same name is created. But old data will be removed.
  It is not a recommended approach.

Q) What if we stop one consumer and start from some time?
  In case of P2P and Pub/Sub?

A)
 P2P : There will be only one consumer. So , all Producer mesages single
 	copy is persisted at MOM Destination. Once consumer is up
	then all Messages are delivered.

 Pub/Sub : Based on No.of Consumers, Cloned Copies are created and sent to
 	consumer applications. [not persisted]
	Ex: 3 consumers are connected first.
	    1 Message in = 3 Message out.
	    If One Consumer is stopped in middle
	    1 Message in = 2 Message out

Input x Consumers = Output
 5    x 0         = 0   (data lost)
 2    x 2         = 4   (delivered)


Q) Does ActiveMQ supports LoadBalancing?
   What if MOM S/w ActiveMQ is down?

A) ActiveMQ comes with single instance (No LoadBalance)
   if it is down data lose may occurs.

=====Execution order===================
1. Start ActiveMQ
2. Start Consumer Application#1 and #2
3. Start Producer application
