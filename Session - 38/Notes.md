Sure! Here's the enhanced response with all the headings in bold:

**Association Mapping (HAS-A)**

**1. Two tables are connected using PK-FK (One Table PK - Another Table FK):**
   In association mapping, we establish a relationship between two tables by connecting them through a primary key (PK) - foreign key (FK) relationship. One table will have the primary key column, while the other table will have the corresponding foreign key column to establish the association between them.

**2. Define two Entity classes for two tables:**
   To map the tables in the database to Java classes, we create two entity classes. Each entity class represents a table in the database. These classes will have attributes that correspond to the columns in their respective tables.

**3. Code written at the PARENT CLASS:**
   When implementing the association mapping, we write the code in the parent class. This class will have a variable representing the child class, which establishes the relationship between the two tables.

**4. Create CHILD CLASS VARIABLE IN PARENT CLASS:**
   In the parent class, we create a variable of the type corresponding to the child class. This variable represents the association between the parent and child classes.

**5. FK Column placement:**
   The placement of the foreign key column depends on the type of relationship we choose (1...1, 1...\*, \*...1, \*...\*). 
   - For one-to-one (1...1) or many-to-one (\*...1) relationships, the foreign key column is created in the table representing the child class.
   - For one-to-many (1...\*) or many-to-many (\*...\*) relationships, the foreign key column is created in the table representing the parent class.

By following these steps, we can establish the association mapping (HAS-A relationship) between two tables in a database. The parent class will have a child class variable, and the foreign key column will be placed either in the parent or child table based on the relationship type.

Sure! Here's an enhanced explanation of the coding steps you mentioned:

**1. Define Entity two classes:**
In order to establish the association mapping (HAS-A relationship), we need to define two entity classes. Each entity class represents a table in the database. These classes will have attributes that correspond to the columns in their respective tables.

**2. Apply HAS-A Relation (Created child class variable in Parent class):**
To implement the HAS-A relationship, we create a variable in the parent class of the type corresponding to the child class. This variable represents the association between the parent and child classes. It allows the parent class to access the child class and vice versa.

**3. Check for Collection/Non-Collection type:**
We need to determine whether the relationship between the parent and child classes is of a collection type or a non-collection type. A collection type indicates a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship, while a non-collection type indicates a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship.

**4. Apply Mapping Annotation and FK Columns:**
Based on the type of relationship, we apply the appropriate mapping annotations and foreign key columns to establish the association between the parent and child classes. For example, if it is a one-to-many relationship, we use the `@OneToMany` annotation in the parent class, and for many-to-one, we use the `@ManyToOne` annotation. We also specify the foreign key column using the `@JoinColumn` annotation.

**5. (Output Sample) Just draw two tables with sample columns:**
To visualize the association mapping, it's helpful to draw the two tables involved in the relationship. Each table represents a class, and the columns in the tables correspond to the attributes or properties of the respective classes. By looking at the tables and their columns, we can understand the structure and association between the entities.

Regarding the three coding examples you provided:
- Example 1 shows the older way of declaring a list with explicit type declaration (`List<Product> pob = new ArrayList<Product>();`).
- Example 2 demonstrates the type inference feature introduced in JDK 1.7, where the type can be inferred by the compiler (`List<Product> pob = new ArrayList<>();`).
- Example 3 shows a common practice in JPA where the list is declared without explicit initialization (`List<Product> pob;`).

These coding steps and examples should help you understand the process of implementing association mapping and the different ways of declaring lists in Java.

Certainly! Here's the breakdown of the provided code snippet:

**1. Entity classes:**
- **Product class:**
```java
package com.app.shivam.entity;

import java.util.List;

import javax.persistence.Column;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.JoinColumn;
import javax.persistence.OneToMany;
import javax.persistence.Table;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Entity
@Table(name="producttab")
public class Product {
	
	@Id
	@Column(name="pid")
	private Integer prodId;
	
	@Column(name="pcode")
	private String prodCode;

	@OneToMany
	@JoinColumn(name="pidFk")
	private List<Model> mobs;

}
```
This class represents the `Product` entity and is annotated with `@Entity` to indicate that it is an entity class mapped to a database table. The `@Table` annotation specifies the name of the table in the database. The class has the following attributes:

  - `prodId`: An `Integer` field annotated with `@Id`, indicating that it is the primary key of the table. It corresponds to the `pid` column in the `producttab` table.
  - `prodCode`: A `String` field representing the product code. It corresponds to the `pcode` column in the `producttab` table.
  - `mobs`: A `List` of `Model` objects representing the association with the `Model` entity. It is annotated with `@OneToMany` to indicate a one-to-many relationship. The `@JoinColumn` annotation is used to specify the foreign key column (`pidFk`) in the `modeltab` table that references the `Product` entity.



- **Model class:**
```java
package com.app.shivam.entity;

import javax.persistence.Column;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.Table;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Entity
@Table(name="modeltab")
public class Model {
	@Id
	@Column(name="mid")
	private Integer modelId;
	@Column(name="mcode")
	private String modelCode;
	@Column(name="mdata")
	private String modelData;
}
```
This class represents the `Model` entity and is also annotated with `@Entity` and `@Table`. The class has the following attributes:

  - `modelId`: An `Integer` field annotated with `@Id`, representing the primary key of the `modeltab` table.
  - `modelCode`: A `String` field representing the model code. It corresponds to the `mcode` column in the `modeltab` table.
  - `modelData`: A `String` field representing some data associated with the model. It corresponds to the `mdata` column in the `modeltab` table.


**2. Repository interfaces:**
- **ModelRepository:**
```java
package com.app.shivam.repo;

import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

import com.app.shivam.entity.Model;

public interface ModelRepository extends JpaRepository<Model, Integer> {

}
```
- **ProductRepository:**
```java
package com.app.shivam.repo;

import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

import com.app.shivam.entity.Product;

public interface ProductRepository extends JpaRepository<Product, Integer> {

}
```
- **ModelRepository:**
This interface extends the `JpaRepository` interface, which provides CRUD operations for the `Model` entity. It uses generics to specify the entity type (`Model`) and the type of the primary key (`Integer`).

- **ProductRepository:**
Similar to `ModelRepository`, this interface extends `JpaRepository` to provide CRUD operations for the `Product` entity.

**3. Runner class:**
```java
package com.app.shivam.runner;

import java.util.Arrays;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import com.app.shivam.entity.Model;
import com.app.shivam.entity.Product;
import com.app.shivam.repo.ModelRepository;
import com.app.shivam.repo.ProductRepository;

@Component
public class TestDataInsertRunner implements CommandLineRunner {

	@Autowired
	private ModelRepository repo;
	
	@Autowired
	private ProductRepository prepo;
	
	public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
		Model m1 = new Model(1012, "XYZ-A", "4GB-128GB-RED");
		Model m2 = new Model(1013, "XYZ-B", "6GB-256GB-GREEN");
		Model m3 = new Model(1014, "MN-C", "12GB-512GB-PINK");
		Model m4 = new Model(1011, "MN-D", "2GB-64GB-BLACK");
		
		Product p1 = new Product(10, "ABCD-XYZ", Arrays.asList(m1,m2));
		Product p2 = new Product(11, "ABCD-MN", Arrays.asList(m3,m4));
		
		repo.save(m1);
		repo.save(m2);
		repo.save(m3);
		repo.save(m4);
		
		prepo.save(p1);
		prepo.save(p2);
	}


}
```
This class implements the `CommandLineRunner` interface, which allows the code to be executed when the application starts. It contains the `run` method, which is invoked automatically. In this method, test data is created and inserted into the database.

  - Four `Model` objects (`m1`, `m2`, `m3`, and `m4`) are created with their respective attributes.
  - Two `Product` objects (`p1` and `p2`) are created, each with a list of associated `Model` objects.
  - The `save` method is called on the `ModelRepository` to save the `Model` objects to the database.
  - The `save` method is called on the `ProductRepository` to save the `Product` objects to the database.

**4. application.yml:**
```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/boot
    username: root
    password: Shivam@123
    
  jpa:
    show-sql: true
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: create
```
The `application.yml` file provides the configuration for the Spring Boot application, including the database connection details and JPA settings.

**Conclusion:**
In this code, we have defined two entity classes (`Product` and `Model`) representing database tables. They have a one-to-many relationship, where each `Product` can have multiple `Model` instances. We have also created repository interfaces for each entity to perform database operations. The `TestDataInsertRunner` class inserts test data into the database using the repositories. Finally, the `application.yml` file contains the configuration settings for the application.

Certainly! Here are the answers to the questions you provided, along with detailed explanations:

1. **What is association mapping in Hibernate/JPA?**<br/>
   - Association mapping is a technique used in Hibernate/JPA to establish relationships between entities or tables in a relational database. It allows you to define how entities are related to each other and how they can be navigated.

2. **How do you establish a relationship between two tables using association mapping?**<br/>
   - To establish a relationship between two tables using association mapping, you need to define two entity classes for the respective tables. In one of the entity classes, you create a variable representing the child class and annotate it accordingly, depending on the relationship type (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many). You also specify the foreign key column using the `@JoinColumn` annotation.

3. **What are the benefits of using association mapping in Hibernate/JPA?**<br/>
   - Association mapping provides several benefits in Hibernate/JPA:
     - It allows you to represent complex relationships between entities in an object-oriented manner.
     - It simplifies querying and navigating data across related entities.
     - It provides cascading operations, where changes made to one entity can automatically propagate to related entities.
     - It enables efficient and optimized database queries by leveraging the underlying ORM framework.

4. **What is the difference between a collection and non-collection type in association mapping?**<br/>
   - In association mapping, a collection type represents a relationship where one entity can be associated with multiple instances of another entity (e.g., one-to-many or many-to-many). A non-collection type represents a relationship where one entity is associated with a single instance of another entity (e.g., one-to-one or many-to-one).

5. **How do you define entity classes in Hibernate/JPA?**<br/>
   - To define entity classes in Hibernate/JPA, you annotate them with the `@Entity` annotation. This annotation indicates that the class represents an entity that will be mapped to a database table. Additionally, you can use annotations like `@Table` to specify the table name and other details.

6. **What is the purpose of the `@Entity` annotation in an entity class?**<br/>
   - The `@Entity` annotation is used to mark a Java class as an entity. It tells Hibernate/JPA that instances of this class should be persisted in the database. The `@Entity` annotation is a mandatory annotation for entity classes.

7. **What is the significance of the `@Table` annotation in an entity class?**<br/>
   - The `@Table` annotation is used to specify the table name and other details for an entity class. It allows you to override the default table name derived from the class name and provides options to configure additional properties such as the schema name, catalog name, etc.

8. **How do you represent a primary key column in an entity class?**<br/>
   - To represent a primary key column in an entity class, you can use the `@Id` annotation on the corresponding field or property. This annotation marks the attribute as the primary key of the entity and is typically used in combination with other annotations like `@GeneratedValue` to specify the generation strategy for the primary key values.

9. **What annotations are used to define a one-to-many relationship in association mapping?**<br/>
   - To define a one-to-many relationship in association mapping, you use the `@OneToMany` annotation in the parent entity class. This annotation indicates that the parent entity can have multiple child entities. Additionally, you need to specify the foreign key column using the `@JoinColumn` annotation.

10. **How do you specify a foreign key column using the `@JoinColumn` annotation?**<br/>
    - The `@JoinColumn` annotation is used to specify the foreign key column in the parent entity class. By default, it uses the name of the child entity's primary key column as the foreign key column. However, you can customize the column name by specifying the `name` attribute of the `@JoinColumn` annotation.

11. **What annotations are used to define a many-to-one relationship in association mapping?**<br/>
    - To define a many-to-one relationship in association mapping, you use the `@ManyToOne` annotation in the parent entity class. This annotation indicates that multiple instances of the parent entity can be associated with a single instance of the child entity. Similar to other associations, you also need to specify the foreign key column using the `@JoinColumn` annotation.

12. **How do you represent a many-to-many relationship in association mapping?**<br/>
    - To represent a many-to-many relationship in association mapping, you use the `@ManyToMany` annotation in both the parent and child entity classes. This annotation indicates that each instance of the parent entity can be associated with multiple instances of the child entity, and vice versa. Additionally, you need to create a join table that holds the associations between the two entities using the `@JoinTable` annotation.

13. **What is the purpose of the `@JoinColumn` annotation?**<br/>
    - The `@JoinColumn` annotation is used to specify the foreign key column in an entity class. It is used in association mappings to indicate the column that holds the reference to the associated entity. It allows you to customize the column name, as well as other attributes such as nullable, unique, etc., using its various attributes like `name`, `nullable`, `unique`, etc.

14. **What is the role of the repository interfaces in the code example?**<br/>
    - The repository interfaces in the code example act as abstractions that define the contract for interacting with the respective entities in the database. They extend the `JpaRepository` interface, which provides generic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and other common database operations. These interfaces enable you to perform database operations on the entities without writing explicit SQL queries.

15. **What is the purpose of the `CommandLineRunner` interface in the runner class?**<br/>
    - The `CommandLineRunner` interface in the runner class is a Spring Boot specific interface that allows you to execute code during the application startup. The `run` method of the `CommandLineRunner` interface is invoked when the application starts, and you can use it to perform any initialization or data insertion tasks. In the provided code, the `run` method inserts sample data into the database.

16. **How is data inserted into the database in the runner class?**<br/>
    - In the runner class, sample data is inserted into the database by creating instances of the entity classes (`Product` and `Model`) and saving them using the repository interfaces (`ModelRepository` and `ProductRepository`). The code creates several instances of `Model` and `Product`, associates them appropriately, and then calls the `save` method of the repository interfaces to persist the data in the database.

17. **What is the purpose of the `application.yml` file?**<br/>
    - The `application.yml` file is a configuration file used by Spring Boot to configure various properties of the application. In the provided code, it contains configurations related to the database connection, such as the URL, username, password, as well as the JPA properties like showing SQL queries, database dialect, and automatic schema generation. These configurations ensure that the application connects to the correct database and performs the required operations.

Please note that these are just example questions, and there can be many more possible questions depending on the specific details and requirements of your project.
