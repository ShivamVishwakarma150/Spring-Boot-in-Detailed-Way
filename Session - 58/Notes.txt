			     Webservices

*) To link two or more applications running at different web-servers
   using HTTP protocol and data as Global Format (XML/JSON).

*) Webservices is also called as Integration.
  ex: BookMyShow App Linked with PayTM.

*) One Application is called as Consumer (Client) and another one
   is called as Producer(Server).

*) Client always makes request to Server application, using
   Http Method and URL.

Http Method says "What todo for a Server"
---- Http Request Methods-------------------
GET     : Fetch Resource from Server
POST    : Create a New Resource at Server
PUT     : Modify existed Resource at Server
DELETE  : Remove existed Resource at Server
PATCH   : Partially Update existed Resource at Server

Other: TRACE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, HEAD
Resource: (File/Image/Doc/DB Data)

Q) Can we use POST Method to Get Data from Server?
A) Actually it supports getting data. But it is not a Http Standard.

Q) What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?
A) PUT : it is recommended to use when full resource is getting modified.
   PATCH: used only for partial data update.

========================================================================
Producer application gives Response Back using Codes/Numbers called as Http Response Status Codes

 ---------------------------------------
  Type               Code
 ---------------------------------------
  Information        1xx
  Success            2xx  (200-OK)
  Redirect           3xx
  Client Side Error  4xx  (404-Not found)
  Server side Error  5xx  (500-Internal Server Error)
