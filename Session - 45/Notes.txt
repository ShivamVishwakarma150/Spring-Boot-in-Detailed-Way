		      Spring Boot - Web Applications 
Q) In how many ways browser can make request?
  a. Enter URL in Addressbar (GET)
    ex: www.google.com
 b. HTML Form Submit (GET/POST)
    ex: Register Form, Login Form, Feedback Form, Comment Form..etc
 c. Click on HyperLink (<a>) (GET)
    ex: Read More, logout, View Here, Menubar options..etc
    <a href="__">___</a>

=> FrontController is concept that dispatch the request to the actual
   place where it can get details/service.
=> It is a Servlet named as DispatchServlet. In Spring F/w we need to configure using web.xml, in Spring boot it is Auto-Configured.

=> Controller is a class, that contains request processing methods. For every module we define one controller.
Project: Gmail
Modules: User, Inbox, Sent, Draft, Settings, Profile ..etc
Project: Amazon
Modules: User, Search, Cart, Payment, Feedback, Returns, ...etc

ex: UserController (addUser,loginUser,viewMyData)
    PaymentController(checkStatus, tryRepay, validateOtp)

Q) Why HandlerMapper is used in Spring WEB MVC?
A) It is a map internally. It holds all controller method details. Like for which path ---> where to Go.

=> Controller Method Returns a ViewName which has no location and extension details. To be independent of UI Technologies.

=> ViewResolver helps to find ViewPage by adding location and extension details.

   ViewPage = Prefix + ViewName + Suffix
             /mypages/  Inbox      .jsp
** In Spring F/w we need to define one <bean> for ViewResolver.
   In Spring Boot it is autoconfigured. Just pass prefix and suffix
   using properties/yaml file.
---Example--------------
   spring.mvc.view.prefix=/WEB-INF/mypages/
   spring.mvc.view.suffix=.jsp
------------------------

=> View(UI) Page will display final result to EndUser inside a Browser.
   Our View Page will be executed and output is given as:HTML(CSS, JS)
   returned back to FC.

=> EL : Expression Language is used to read data from Model(memory).
   Syntax: ${keyName}.
   At runtime all expressions are replaced with their data taken from
   Model is called as Rendering.
=======================================================================
SpringBoot WEB Module:-
=> This module provides all annotations , configurations to work with WebApps
=> Spring Boot Web MVC provided Embedded Server(No Download + No Install) Apache Tomcat(default), Eclipse Jetty, JBoss Undertow.

=> Application package format is : WAR (Web Archive)
   Archive = Group of files as one bundle.

**** Even we can use JAR Format also for webapp.

Q) Which option we need to choose for Web Application Packaing?
A) We can use JAR if we want to work with embedded Server. For external Deployment use : WAR option only.

*) EAR: Enterprise Archive = EJB + WEB APP TYPE (It is removed).

----------------------------------------------------------------
Port Number: 0-65535 (65536)
A Logical number assigned by OS, to identify a service.
At a time two different services can not use same port number.
=> 0-1024 are called as reserved port numbers.
=> Http - 80, https-443.

*) Default port number for Spring Boot app is : 8080
  We can modify using key : server.port=9090
