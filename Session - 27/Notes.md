# `JPA`

JPA is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework or API that provides a set of interfaces and classes to perform database operations using Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

Here are some key points regarding JPA and its features:

1. Object-Relational Mapping: JPA allows developers to map Java objects to database tables, providing a seamless integration between the object-oriented and relational paradigms.

2. EntityManager: The EntityManager is the central interface in JPA for performing CRUD operations on entities. It represents a persistence context, which is a set of managed entity instances. The EntityManager provides methods like `persist()`, `merge()`, `find()`, and `remove()` to perform operations like saving, updating, selecting, and deleting entities.

3. Persistence Context: The persistence context is a cache-like environment within the EntityManager that keeps track of managed entities. It maintains the state of entities, manages their relationships, and tracks changes made to the entities. The EntityManager is responsible for synchronizing these changes with the underlying database.

4. Entity Lifecycle Management: JPA manages the lifecycle of entities, including entity instantiation, persistence, retrieval, updating, and removal. It provides mechanisms for persisting new entities, loading existing entities, updating entity state, and removing entities from the persistence context.

5. Object-Oriented Operations: With JPA, developers can perform database operations using object-oriented concepts rather than writing SQL queries manually. They can work with entities as Java objects, leveraging object-oriented features like inheritance, polymorphism, and associations.

6. Transaction Management: JPA provides transaction management capabilities, allowing developers to define transaction boundaries and manage transactional operations. The EntityTransaction interface is used to control the transactional behavior of the EntityManager, including beginning, committing, and rolling back transactions.

By utilizing JPA and its EntityManager, developers can interact with the database using object-oriented concepts and benefit from automatic mapping between entities and database tables. This simplifies the development process, improves code maintainability, and enhances productivity by reducing the amount of boilerplate SQL code that needs to be written manually.

It's important to note that JPA is just a specification or API, and Hibernate is one of the popular implementations of JPA. Other implementations like EclipseLink and OpenJPA also adhere to the JPA specification, providing similar functionality with some differences in configuration and features.

# Data JPA 

Data JPA is a feature provided by Spring Boot that simplifies database operations by generating code based on the specified interfaces. It internally uses the JPA (Java Persistence API) code to perform these operations.

Here are the key points to understand about Data JPA:

1. Code Generation: Data JPA generates the necessary code to perform common database operations, such as insert, update, delete, and select. It reduces the amount of boilerplate code that developers need to write for these operations.

2. Repository Interface: To utilize Data JPA, you need to define a repository interface that extends one of the provided interfaces: `CrudRepository`, `PagingAndSortingRepository`, or `JpaRepository`. These interfaces define the basic database operations and additional features like sorting and pagination.

3. Entity Class: In addition to the repository interface, you need to define the entity class that represents the database table. This entity class should be annotated with JPA annotations, specifying the table structure and mapping between the class variables and table columns.

4. Dynamic Proxy: Data JPA uses dynamic proxy to generate an implementation of the repository interface at runtime. This dynamic proxy class intercepts the method calls made on the repository interface and delegates them to the appropriate JPA methods for database operations.

5. SimpleJpaRepository: Internally, Data JPA uses the `SimpleJpaRepository` class to provide the implementation for the repository interfaces. This class contains the generic JPA code for performing database operations. It is a template class that can be applied to any entity class.

6. Additional Features: Data JPA provides additional features like sorting, pagination, batch operations, and example queries. These features can be utilized by extending the appropriate repository interface (`PagingAndSortingRepository` or `JpaRepository`) and leveraging the methods defined in those interfaces.

By using Data JPA, developers can leverage the generated code to perform database operations without explicitly writing the implementation logic. It saves time and effort in writing boilerplate code for common CRUD operations. Developers only need to define the entity class, repository interface, and configure the necessary properties for database connection and JPA settings.

It's worth mentioning that Data JPA is just one of the many features provided by Spring Boot to simplify application development. It aims to integrate JPA with the Spring ecosystem and provides additional features to enhance productivity when working with databases in a Spring Boot application.

# Here's a detailed explanation of the given interfaces provided by Spring Boot's Data JPA:

1. CrudRepository<T, ID>:
   - It is an interface that provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
   - The generic type `T` represents the entity class for which the operations are performed.
   - The generic type `ID` represents the data type of the entity's primary key.
   - This interface includes methods such as `save()`, `findById()`, `delete()`, and `findAll()` for performing CRUD operations on entities.

2. PagingAndSortingRepository<T, ID>:
   - It extends the `CrudRepository` interface and adds additional features for sorting and pagination of data.
   - In addition to the basic CRUD operations, it provides methods for sorting and pagination, such as `findAll(Sort)` and `findAll(Pageable)`.
   - The `Sort` object specifies the sorting criteria, and the `Pageable` object defines the pagination settings, including page size, current page number, and sorting.

3. JpaRepository<T, ID>:
   - It extends the `PagingAndSortingRepository` interface and adds more advanced JPA-specific operations.
   - It includes methods for JPA-based operations like flushing changes to the database, deleting records in batch, and obtaining the entity manager.
   - It also provides methods for performing example-based queries, where you can pass an example entity to find entities that match its properties.

These interfaces are part of the Spring Data JPA module and are designed to simplify database operations by providing pre-defined methods for common tasks. By extending these interfaces, you inherit the methods and functionalities they offer, eliminating the need to write repetitive code for basic database operations.

It's important to note that while these interfaces provide convenient methods, you can still define custom queries using JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) or native SQL queries when needed. Additionally, Spring Boot's Data JPA supports automatic query generation based on method names, allowing you to create queries without writing SQL manually.

By using these interfaces, developers can benefit from the predefined methods and functionality provided by Spring Boot's Data JPA, reducing the amount of boilerplate code needed for database operations and improving development efficiency.

<br/>

Certainly! Here's a detailed explanation of the points you mentioned:

1. SimpleJpaRepository<T, ID>:
   - SimpleJpaRepository is a class provided by Spring Boot's Data JPA that internally contains the JPA code for the CRUD operations defined in the repository interfaces.
   - It is a template class, meaning it provides a generic implementation of the database operations that can be applied to any entity class.
   - The generic type `T` represents the entity class for which the operations are performed.
   - The generic type `ID` represents the data type of the entity's primary key.
   - This class includes the actual implementation of methods like `save()`, `findById()`, `delete()`, and `findAll()` based on JPA specifications and best practices.

2. Interface extension:
   - To utilize the functionality provided by SimpleJpaRepository, you need to define an interface that extends any one of the repository interfaces mentioned earlier (CrudRepository, PagingAndSortingRepository, or JpaRepository).
   - By extending one of these interfaces, your custom repository interface inherits the methods and functionality provided by SimpleJpaRepository.
   - You can then define additional methods in your custom repository interface, if needed, to include any specific queries or operations required for your application.

3. Dynamic Proxy:
   - When Spring Boot's Data JPA is enabled, it dynamically generates a proxy class at runtime for your custom repository interface.
   - This dynamic proxy class internally utilizes the SimpleJpaRepository to provide the actual implementation of the methods defined in the repository interface.
   - The proxy class intercepts method calls made to the repository interface and delegates them to the corresponding methods in SimpleJpaRepository for execution.
   - This dynamic proxy mechanism allows Spring Boot to automatically generate the necessary database operations without requiring explicit implementation in your custom repository interface.

Overall, SimpleJpaRepository serves as a template class that provides a generic implementation of the database operations specified in the repository interfaces. By extending one of the repository interfaces and utilizing the dynamic proxy mechanism, Spring Boot's Data JPA generates a concrete class that combines the functionality of SimpleJpaRepository with any additional methods defined in your custom repository interface. This approach reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed for database operations and allows for efficient and consistent data access across different entity classes in your application.

#  Here's a detailed explanation of the points you mentioned:

1. Entity vs. DTO:
   - Entity: An entity class is a class that is mapped with a database table. It represents a persistent object that can be stored and retrieved from the database.
     - It typically contains properties that directly correspond to the columns in the database table.
     - The entity class may include additional annotations or configurations to define the mapping between the class and the database table.

   - DTO (Data Transfer Object): A DTO is a class that contains data and defines how data is transferred between different layers or components of an application.
     - It is typically used to encapsulate data and pass it between methods or modules.
     - DTOs often have a subset of the properties of an entity and may include additional properties derived from multiple entities or other sources.
     - DTOs are useful in scenarios where you want to control the data that is exposed or transmitted between different parts of the application and avoid exposing the entire entity.

2. DAO and DTO:
   - DAO (Data Access Object): DAO is a design pattern that represents a class responsible for performing database operations.
     - It encapsulates the logic to interact with the database, such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records.
     - The DAO pattern separates the data access logic from the business logic, providing a modular and maintainable approach for database operations.

   - DTO (Data Transfer Object): As mentioned earlier, a DTO is a class used to transfer data between methods or layers of an application.
     - It serves as a container for data and typically contains getters and setters to access and modify the data.
     - DTOs help in decoupling the data representation from the business logic and provide a consistent way to pass data between different parts of the application.

3. Repository:
   - Repository is an interface defined in the context of Spring Data.
   - It represents a collection of objects or entities of a specific type and provides methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on those objects.
   - Repositories in Spring Data provide a higher-level abstraction for data access and eliminate the need for manual implementation of database operations.
   - By extending repository interfaces, you inherit the predefined CRUD methods and can also define custom query methods to retrieve data based on specific criteria.

4. Dynamic Proxy:
   - Dynamic Proxy is a mechanism in Java that allows the creation of proxy classes at runtime.
   - It involves creating a proxy object that intercepts method calls to another object and performs additional operations before or after the method invocation.
   - Dynamic proxies are typically used in scenarios where you want to add functionality or behavior to existing objects without modifying their original implementation.
   - In the context of Spring Boot's Data JPA, dynamic proxies are used to generate proxy classes for repository interfaces.
   - These proxy classes intercept method calls made to the repository interfaces and delegate them to the appropriate implementation, such as SimpleJpaRepository, allowing for transparent database operations without explicit implementation in the repository interfaces.

#  Here providing the code and explanations for each class separately:

1. Entity class (Student):

```java
package com.app.shivam.entity;

import javax.persistence.Column;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.Table;

import lombok.Data;

@Data
@Entity
@Table(name = "student_tab")
public class Student {
    @Id
    @Column(name = "sid")
    private Integer stdId;

    @Column(name = "sname")
    private String stdName;

    @Column(name = "sfee")
    private Double stdFee;
}
```

Explanation:
- The `Student` class represents an entity for a student in the application.
- It is annotated with `@Entity`, indicating that it is a JPA entity and will be mapped to a database table.
- The `@Table` annotation specifies the name of the table in the database where the entity will be stored.
- The class has three properties: `stdId`, `stdName`, and `stdFee`, which correspond to the columns in the table.
- The `@Id` annotation is used to specify the primary key of the entity, in this case, `stdId`.

2. Repository interface (StudentRepository):

```java
package com.app.shivam.repo;

import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

import com.app.shivam.entity.Student;

public interface StudentRepository extends JpaRepository<Student, Integer> {

}
```

Explanation:
- The `StudentRepository` interface extends the `JpaRepository` interface provided by Spring Data JPA.
- It specifies the entity type (`Student`) and the data type of the primary key (`Integer`).
- Spring Data JPA provides common database operations such as save, delete, findById, etc., without the need for explicit implementations.

3. Properties file (application.properties):

```properties
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/boot
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=Shivam@123

spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

Explanation:
- The `application.properties` file contains configuration properties for the application.
- It specifies the database connection details such as the driver class, URL, username, and password.
- JPA-specific properties are also set, including showing SQL queries (`spring.jpa.show-sql`), specifying the database dialect (`spring.jpa.database-platform`), and enabling automatic schema updates (`spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto`).

4. Runner class (TestOprRunner):

```java
package com.app.shivam.runner;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import com.app.shivam.entity.Student;
import com.app.shivam.repo.StudentRepository;

@Component
public class TestOprRunner implements CommandLineRunner {

    @Autowired
    private StudentRepository repo;

    public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
        System.out.println(repo.getClass().getName());

        Student student = new Student();
        student.setStdId(99);
        student.setStdName("SAM");
        student.setStdFee(20000.0);

        repo.save(student); // INSERT OR UPDATE
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- The `TestOprRunner` class implements the `CommandLineRunner` interface, allowing the code to run when the application starts.
- The class is annotated with `@Component`, indicating that it is a Spring bean and will be automatically detected and instantiated.
- The `StudentRepository` is autowired to the runner class for performing database operations.
- In the

 `run` method, a new instance of the `Student` entity is created and populated with data.
- The `repo.save(student)` method is called to save the student entity to the database. If the entity already exists, it will be updated.

Conclusion:
The provided code demonstrates the usage of Spring Data JPA with MySQL. It showcases the creation of an entity class, a repository interface extending `JpaRepository`, and a runner class to perform database operations. The configuration properties define the database connection and JPA settings. This setup allows for easy and efficient interaction with the database using JPA-based operations provided by Spring Data JPA.
