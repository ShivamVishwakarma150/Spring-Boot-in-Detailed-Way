## The recommended coding order for implementing CRUD operations using Spring Boot with WEB MVC, Thymeleaf, Data JPA, and MySQL is as follows:

1. Entity:
   - Start by creating the entity class that represents the database table (schema).
   - Define the fields and their mappings using JPA annotations such as `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, `@GeneratedValue`, etc.
   - Add any additional annotations or configurations required for the entity.

2. Repository:
   - Create a repository interface that extends the appropriate Spring Data JPA repository, such as `JpaRepository`.
   - Declare any custom query methods or use the default methods provided by the repository.
   - Optionally, add any additional annotations or configurations required for the repository.

3. Service:
   - Create a service interface that defines the contract for performing CRUD operations and other business logic.
   - Declare methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting entities.
   - Implement any additional business logic or validation required for the operations.
   - Handle any exceptions that may occur during the service operations and throw appropriate exceptions if needed.
   - Optionally, use transaction management annotations such as `@Transactional` to control the transactional behavior of the service methods.

4. Controller:
   - Create a controller class that handles the incoming HTTP requests and interacts with the service layer.
   - Annotate the class with `@Controller` or `@RestController` to indicate that it is a controller.
   - Use the appropriate annotations such as `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc., to map the URLs and HTTP methods to the controller methods.
   - Inject the service interface using `@Autowired` or constructor injection.
   - Implement the controller methods to handle the CRUD operations by calling the corresponding methods in the service layer.
   - Optionally, perform any additional request processing, validation, or data transformation required.
   - Return appropriate responses, such as model objects or views, depending on the application's needs.

By following this recommended coding order, you can establish a structured approach to implementing CRUD operations using Spring Boot with WEB MVC, Thymeleaf, Data JPA, and MySQL. This order ensures that you build the foundational components (entity, repository, service) before implementing the request processing logic in the controller.

# Here's the code for each class in separate sections, followed by a detailed explanation and a conclusion:

1. Entity class (Employee.java):
```java
package com.app.shivam.entity;

import javax.persistence.Column;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.Table;

import lombok.Data;

@Data
@Table(name = "emptab")
@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    @Column(name = "eid")
    private Integer empId;

    @Column(name = "ename")
    private String empName;

    @Column(name = "esal")
    private Double empSal;

    @Column(name = "ehra")
    private Double empHra;

    @Column(name = "eta")
    private Double empTa;

    @Column(name = "edept")
    private String empDept;
}
```
Explanation: 
- This class represents the `Employee` entity, which corresponds to the `emptab` table in the database.
- It uses Lombok annotations `@Data` to generate getter and setter methods automatically.
- The fields are annotated with JPA annotations such as `@Column` to define the column mappings and `@Id` to mark the primary key.
- The `@GeneratedValue` annotation with `GenerationType.IDENTITY` strategy is used for auto-generation of the primary key.

2. Repository interface (EmployeeRepository.java):
```java
package com.app.shivam.repo;

import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

import com.app.shivam.entity.Employee;

public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, Integer> {

}
```
Explanation:
- This interface extends the `JpaRepository` provided by Spring Data JPA, which provides various methods for CRUD operations.
- The repository is parameterized with the `Employee` entity and the primary key type (`Integer`).

3. Service interface (IEmployeeService.java):
```java
package com.app.shivam.service;

import java.util.List;

import com.app.shivam.entity.Employee;

public interface IEmployeeService {

    Integer saveEmployee(Employee e);
    void updateEmployee(Employee e);
    void deleteEmployee(Integer id);
    Employee getOneEmployee(Integer id);
    List<Employee> getAllEmployees();
}
```
Explanation:
- This interface defines the contract for the Employee service, specifying the methods for CRUD operations and retrieving employee data.

4. Service implementation class (EmployeeServiceImpl.java):
```java
package com.app.shivam.service.impl;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import com.app.shivam.entity.Employee;
import com.app.shivam.repo.EmployeeRepository;
import com.app.shivam.service.IEmployeeService;

@Service
public class EmployeeServiceImpl implements IEmployeeService {

    @Autowired
    private EmployeeRepository repo;

    public Integer saveEmployee(Employee e) {
        e = repo.save(e);
        return e.getEmpId();
    }

    public void updateEmployee(Employee e) {
        repo.save(e);
    }

    public void deleteEmployee(Integer id) {
        repo.deleteById(id);
    }

    public Employee getOneEmployee(Integer id) {
        Optional<Employee> opt = repo.findById(id);
        return opt.get();
    }

    public List<Employee> getAllEmployees() {
        List<Employee> list = repo.findAll();
        return list;
    }
}
```
Explanation:
- This class implements the `IEmployeeService` interface and provides the actual implementation for the service methods.
- It is annotated with `@Service` to indicate that it's a Spring service bean.
- The `EmployeeRepository` is injected using `@Autowired` to perform CRUD operations on the database.

5.

 Controller class (EmployeeController.java):
```java
package com.app.shivam.controller;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.ui.Model;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ModelAttribute;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;

import com.app.shivam.entity.Employee;
import com.app.shivam.service.IEmployeeService;

@Controller
@RequestMapping("/employee")
public class EmployeeController {

    @Autowired
    private IEmployeeService service;

    @GetMapping("/register")
    public String showRegPage() {
        return "EmployeeRegister";
    }

    @PostMapping("/save")
    public String saveFormData(@ModelAttribute Employee employee, Model model) {
        Integer id = service.saveEmployee(employee);
        String message = "EMPLOYEE '" + id + "' CREATED";
        model.addAttribute("message", message);
        return "EmployeeRegister";
    }
}
```
Explanation:
- This class serves as the controller for handling HTTP requests related to employees.
- It is annotated with `@Controller` to mark it as a Spring MVC controller.
- The `IEmployeeService` is injected using `@Autowired` to interact with the employee service.
- The `showRegPage()` method is mapped to the GET request for `/employee/register` and returns the view for the employee registration page.
- The `saveFormData()` method is mapped to the POST request for `/employee/save` and saves the employee data received from the form submission.
- The `Model` object is used to pass data back to the view.

Conclusion:
The provided code showcases a simple implementation of a CRUD operation for the Employee module using Spring Boot with WEB MVC, Thymeleaf, Data JPA, and MySQL. It covers the entity class representing the database table, the repository for database operations, the service layer for business logic, and the controller for handling HTTP requests. The Thymeleaf templates are used for rendering the views. This code can be further enhanced by adding more CRUD operations, validation, error handling, and additional features as per the application's requirements.

## **Q) Why Strings are immutable ?**

Strings are immutable in Java because of several reasons:

1. Security: Immutable strings are used in various security-related operations such as hashing, encryption, and authentication. Immutable strings ensure that their values cannot be modified, preventing any tampering or unauthorized access.

2. Thread Safety: Since strings are immutable, they can be safely shared among multiple threads without the need for synchronization. This simplifies concurrent programming and eliminates the risk of race conditions or inconsistencies when multiple threads access the same string.

3. Caching and Performance: String literals in Java are stored in a string constant pool, which allows the JVM to reuse existing string objects. This reduces memory usage and improves performance by avoiding the creation of duplicate string objects. Immutability ensures that the stored strings cannot be modified accidentally.

4. Hashcode and Equality: The immutability of strings guarantees that their hashcode remains constant throughout their lifetime. This property is crucial for using strings as keys in hash-based data structures like HashMap and HashSet. Immutable strings also facilitate reliable equality comparison using the `equals()` method.

5. API Design and Predictability: By making strings immutable, Java provides a consistent and predictable behavior. Developers can rely on strings to remain unchanged once created, making code easier to reason about and debug.

Overall, the immutability of strings in Java ensures security, thread safety, performance optimizations, and predictable behavior, making them a fundamental and widely used data type in Java applications.

The options mentioned are related to the `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` property in Spring Boot applications. This property is used to control the behavior of Hibernate's schema generation or validation during application startup. Here's a brief explanation of each option:

1. `create`: This option will create a new database table schema based on the entity classes defined in your application. If a table with the same name already exists, it will be dropped and a new table will be created.

2. `update`: With this option, Hibernate will try to update the existing database schema based on the entity classes. It will add new tables, columns, or constraints as necessary. Existing data will not be modified or deleted. If a table doesn't exist, it will be created.

3. `validate`: This option validates the entity classes against the database schema. It checks if the tables and columns match the entity mappings. If there are any inconsistencies or missing tables/columns, an exception will be thrown during application startup.

4. `none`: With this option, Hibernate does not perform any schema management. It assumes that the required database schema already exists and is compatible with the entity mappings. No changes or validations are made to the schema.

5. `create-drop`: This option is similar to the `create` option, but it also drops the newly created tables when the application shuts down. This can be useful for development or testing environments where you want a fresh database schema for each run.

It's important to note that using the `create` or `create-drop` options in a production environment can lead to data loss, as existing tables are dropped. In production, it's generally recommended to use `update` or `validate` options to ensure that the schema changes are applied safely.

You can choose the appropriate option based on your application's requirements and the stage of development or deployment.
