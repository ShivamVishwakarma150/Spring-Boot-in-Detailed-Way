**@CrossOrigin:**

`@CrossOrigin` is an annotation used in Java Spring Boot applications to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). CORS is a mechanism that allows resources (e.g., APIs) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated. In the given example, the `@CrossOrigin` annotation is used at the class level of a REST controller to allow requests from two specific origins, "http://localhost:3000" and "http://localhost:4200".

**ReactJS using TypeScript:**

ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript. By using TypeScript with ReactJS, you gain type checking and enhanced tooling support. The link provided in the note points to the TypeScript handbook documentation specifically for using React with TypeScript.

**HOC (Higher-Order Components):**

Higher-Order Components (HOCs) are functions that take a component as input and return an enhanced version of that component. They are used to reuse component logic, add additional functionality, or modify the behavior of a component. HOCs are a way to implement code reusability in React.

---

**Hooks:**

React Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. They were introduced in React 16.8 as a way to write reusable logic without writing class components. Hooks provide a simpler and more flexible way to manage state and side effects in functional components.

---

**Lifecycle Methods:**

Lifecycle methods are methods that are invoked at different stages of a component's lifecycle in React. Class components in React have a set of predefined lifecycle methods such as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`. These methods allow you to perform certain actions at specific points during a component's lifespan, like initializing data, updating the UI, or cleaning up resources.

---

**Redux:**

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, commonly used with React. It provides a centralized store to manage the state of an application and follows a unidirectional data flow pattern. Redux helps in managing complex application state, making it easier to track changes, debug, and maintain the state of the application.

**Testing:**

Testing in React involves different techniques and frameworks to ensure the correctness and stability of the application. There are various testing approaches such as unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing. Popular testing frameworks for React applications include Jest, Enzyme, and React Testing Library. These frameworks enable developers to write tests for components, check behaviors, and make sure the application functions as expected.

---

**Web page and Components:**

In React, a web page is built by composing different components together. Components are self-contained, reusable pieces of code that represent a specific part or functionality of a web page. For example, a web page might consist of components like a header, navbar, body, side panel, and footer. Each component has its own logic, styling, and functionality, and they can be combined to create complex UI structures.

---

**Class Components vs. Functional Components:**

React components can be classified into two types: class components and functional components. Class components are stateful components that manage data and have lifecycle methods. They are defined using ES6 classes and extend the `React.Component` class. Functional components, on the other hand, are stateless components that don't manage data or have lifecycle methods. They are defined as JavaScript functions and receive props as input and return the rendered UI.

---

**useState():**

The `useState` hook is a built-in hook in React that allows functional components to manage state. It returns a state variable

 and a function to update that variable. The initial state can be passed as an argument to `useState`. For example, `const [student, setStudent] = useState(initialFormState)` initializes a `student` state variable with `initialFormState`, and `setStudent` is a function that can be used to update the `student` state.

---

**useNavigate():**

The `useNavigate` hook is a part of React Router, which is used for handling navigation and routing in React applications. The `useNavigate` hook returns a navigate function that allows you to programmatically navigate to different routes or paths within your application. It can be used, for example, when a user performs an action that requires moving from one component to another.

---

**useParams():**

The `useParams` hook is also part of React Router. It allows functional components to access the parameters defined in the URL path. When a route is configured with a dynamic parameter, such as `<Route path="/users/:id" />`, the `useParams` hook can be used to retrieve the value of that parameter. It returns an object containing the parameter values specified in the route's path.

---

**useEffect():**

The `useEffect` hook is used to perform side effects in functional components. It allows you to execute a callback function based on certain dependencies. The callback function will be executed after the component has rendered or when the dependencies have changed. This hook is commonly used for fetching data, subscribing to events, or performing cleanup operations. The dependencies array specifies the values that the effect depends on, and whenever any of these values change, the effect is re-run.

---

**Difference between Route paths `/` and `*`:**

In React Router, the `/` path represents the default home page route. It matches the root URL of the application. For example, `<Route path="/" element={<StudentListComponent />} />` specifies that when the root URL is accessed, the `StudentListComponent` should be rendered.

On the other hand, the `*` path acts as a catch-all or fallback route. It is used when no other routes match the requested URL. For example, `<Route path="*" element={<NotFoundComponent />} />` specifies that if the URL doesn't match any defined routes, the `NotFoundComponent` should be rendered. This can be useful for displaying a "404 Not Found" page or handling other cases when the requested URL doesn't correspond to any known routes.
