# Let's break down the points you mentioned and provide a detailed explanation for each:

1. "If we use Optional as ReturnType": The `Optional` type in many programming languages is used to indicate that a value may or may not be present. It is often used when a method or operation could potentially return a null or empty result. By using `Optional` as the return type, you're signaling that the result of the query may or may not have a value.

2. "Query may return Multiple rows output": This means that the query you execute can potentially return more than one row of data as a result. In a database context, a query is used to retrieve information from a database, and if the query matches multiple rows based on the specified criteria, all those rows will be returned as output.

3. "NonUniqueResultException: query did not return a unique result: 5 may be raised": This exception typically occurs when you expect a single result from a query, but the query actually returns multiple rows. The "5" mentioned here is an example value indicating that the query returned five rows. Since the expectation was to have a unique (single) result, the exception is raised to indicate that the query did not meet this expectation.

In summary, if you use `Optional` as the return type for a query that can potentially return multiple rows of data, you may encounter a `NonUniqueResultException` if the query indeed returns more than one row. This exception is raised to indicate that the expected uniqueness of the result was violated.

To handle this situation, you have a few options:

1. Adjust the query: Modify the query to include additional criteria or constraints that ensure a unique result is returned. This could involve adding more specific conditions to the query or using aggregate functions to combine multiple rows into a single result.

2. Revise the return type: Instead of using `Optional`, you can change the return type to a collection or list that can hold multiple results. This way, you can handle and process all the returned rows effectively.

3. Implement appropriate error handling: If you expect a unique result and receiving multiple rows is considered an exceptional scenario, you can catch the `NonUniqueResultException` and handle it accordingly. You may choose to log an error, throw a custom exception, or take any other appropriate action based on your application's requirements.

It's important to consider the specific programming language, database system, and frameworks you're using, as the exact implementation and error handling may vary.
