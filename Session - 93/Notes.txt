Plan -> Document -> Development -> Build -> Test -> Release -> Monitor

We are having different monitoring tools like:
1. Admin Server (+Actuator)
2. Zipkin and Slueth

These are tools used to know the current status of applications/MS# running 

*) Actuator : Set of Production Ready Endpoints.
It gives some pre-defined services which are commonly used in Production
Environment for every MS# apps. Like:  Health Checking, Beans detaiks, 
 mapping inforation(URL,HttpMethods), cache, heap, thread dumps..etc

=> If we use only 'Actuator' that is manual process of using/checking services. We should also Integrate Admin Server to have GUI based checking.

=======Steps to activate Actuator services=========================
S#1 Add Actuator Dependency in MS# 
> Right click > Add Starter > Actuator > Next > pom.xml checkbox
> next > finish

pom.xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>

S#2 Enable Services
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
#management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,beans,env


S#3 Enter URL :  http://IP:PORT/actuator

Ex:
http://localhost:8082/actuator


Note:
1. If we did not specify any include services then default only
  one service 'health' is activated.
  (old versions : Upto 2.4.x -- 2 were activated - health, info)

2. Enter service URL to check their details
http://localhost:8082/actuator/beans
http://localhost:8082/actuator/env

======================================================================
			Spring Cloud Adminserver

It is a central server that is used to Monitor Actuator Results of 
Every MS# which is connected using Admin Client and ADMIN URL.

*) MS# will connect to Admin Server using Admin Client.
*) Actuator must be enabled at every MS# then only Admin Client
  can read its information.

===Coding Steps=============================
1. Admin Server
Name : SpringCloudAdminServer
Dep  : Admin Server

> At main class: @EnableAdminServer
> application.properties
server.port=9999

2. At MS#
*) Add Two Dependencies : Actuator, Admin Client

*) At MS# Properties file
#Activate Actuator
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*

#Connect with Admin Server
spring.boot.admin.client.url=http://localhost:9999


--Execution order-------
1. Eureka Server | Config Server | Admin Server
2. MS# Apps (create multiple instances)

http://localhost:8761/
http://localhost:8888/actuator/refresh
http://localhost:9999/applications
