**JACKSON API Overview:**

The JACKSON API is an open-source Java API that provides functionality for converting Java objects to JSON (Java Object Notation) and JSON to Java objects. It is commonly used in web applications, especially with frameworks like Spring Boot, to handle JSON data serialization and deserialization.

**ObjectMapper:**

The `ObjectMapper` class is the central class in the JACKSON API for performing JSON serialization and deserialization. It provides methods to write Java objects as JSON and read JSON into Java objects. Some of the commonly used methods of the `ObjectMapper` class are:

1. `writeValueAsString(Object value)`: This method serializes a Java object to its corresponding JSON string representation. It takes an object as input and returns the JSON string.

2. `readValue(String content, Class<T> valueType)`: This method deserializes a JSON string into a Java object of the specified type. It takes the JSON string and the target class type as input and returns the deserialized object.

**Example Code:**

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonProcessingException;

public class JacksonExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance of the ObjectMapper
        ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();

        try {
            // Convert Java object to JSON string
            MyObject myObject = new MyObject("John Doe", 25);
            String jsonString = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(myObject);
            System.out.println("JSON String: " + jsonString);

            // Convert JSON string to Java object
            String json = "{\"name\":\"Jane Smith\",\"age\":30}";
            MyObject parsedObject = objectMapper.readValue(json, MyObject.class);
            System.out.println("Parsed Object: " + parsedObject);
        } catch (JsonProcessingException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

class MyObject {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public MyObject() {}

    public MyObject(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Getters and setters

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "MyObject [name=" + name + ", age=" + age + "]";
    }
}
```

In the above example, we create an instance of the `ObjectMapper` class. We then demonstrate the conversion between a Java object (`MyObject`) and its JSON representation. The `writeValueAsString` method converts the `MyObject` instance to a JSON string, and the `readValue` method converts the JSON string back to a `MyObject` instance.

**Conclusion:**

The JACKSON API, particularly the `ObjectMapper` class, provides a convenient way to convert Java objects to JSON and vice versa. It is widely used in Java applications, including Spring Boot, to handle JSON serialization and deserialization. By utilizing the JACKSON API, developers can easily work with JSON data in their Java applications and facilitate communication with web services that use JSON as the data format.

**1. Model / Entity:**

```java
package com.app.shivam.entity;

import lombok.Data;

@Data
public class StockInfo {
	private Integer stkId;
	private String stkCode;
	private Double stkCost;
}
```

Explanation:
- The `StockInfo` class represents a model or entity that holds information about a stock.
- It has three properties: `stkId`, `stkCode`, and `stkCost`.
- The `@Data` annotation from the Lombok library automatically generates getters, setters, `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()` methods for the properties, reducing boilerplate code.

**2. Test class:**

```java
package com.app.shivam;

import com.app.shivam.entity.StockInfo;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

public class Test {
	
	// JSON to Object
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		String json = "{\"stkId\":101,\"stkCode\":\"A\",\"stkCost\":200.0}";

		try {
			ObjectMapper om = new ObjectMapper();
			StockInfo si = om.readValue(json, StockInfo.class);
			System.out.println(si);
		} catch (Exception e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}

	// Object to JSON
	public static void main1(String[] args) {
		StockInfo si = new StockInfo();
		si.setStkCode("A");
		si.setStkCost(200.0);
		si.setStkId(101);

		try {
			ObjectMapper om = new ObjectMapper();
			String s = om.writeValueAsString(si);
			System.out.println(s);
		} catch (Exception e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
}
```

Explanation:
- The `Test` class demonstrates the conversion between JSON and `StockInfo` objects using the `ObjectMapper` class from the JACKSON API.
- It contains two methods: `main` and `main1`, each showcasing a different conversion direction.

**JSON to Object:**

- In the `main` method, a JSON string representing stock information is provided: `{"stkId":101,"stkCode":"A","stkCost":200.0}`.
- An instance of `ObjectMapper` is created, which is responsible for the JSON serialization and deserialization.
- The `readValue` method of `ObjectMapper` is used to deserialize the JSON string into a `StockInfo` object.
- The deserialized `StockInfo` object is then printed to the console.

**Object to JSON:**

- In the `main1` method, a `StockInfo` object is created manually with some values.
- An instance of `ObjectMapper` is created.
- The `writeValueAsString` method of `ObjectMapper` is used to serialize the `StockInfo` object into a JSON string.
- The serialized JSON string is then printed to the console.

**Conclusion:**

The provided code demonstrates how to use the JACKSON API for converting between JSON and `StockInfo` objects. The `ObjectMapper` class enables seamless serialization and deserialization, allowing easy integration of JSON data into Java applications. By leveraging JACKSON's functionality, developers can efficiently handle data interchange between JSON and Java objects.

**Topic in Apache Kafka:**

- Apache Kafka is a distributed messaging system that operates based on topics. Topics are the central concept in Kafka and are used to organize and store messages.
- Topics in Kafka follow a publish/subscribe model, where producers publish messages to a topic, and consumers subscribe to the topic to receive and process those messages.
- Kafka topics are highly scalable and can handle large amounts of data.
- Topics are identified by their name, which is a string identifier.

**Creating a Topic:**

- In Spring Kafka, you can create a topic using the `TopicBuilder` class or by letting the `KafkaTemplate` create it on the fly at runtime.
- The `TopicBuilder` allows you to define the properties of the topic, such as the name, number of partitions, and replication factor.
- The number of partitions determines the parallelism and scalability of consuming and processing messages. It is based on factors such as the expected message load and processing requirements.
- The replication factor specifies the number of replicas (copies) of each partition to maintain for fault tolerance and high availability.
- The `NewTopic` bean is created using `TopicBuilder.name("topic1")` to specify the topic name, `.partitions(10)` to set the number of partitions, and `.replicas(1)` to set the replication factor.
- The default values for partitions and replicas are 1 if not explicitly specified.

**Groups in Apache Kafka:**

- Groups in Kafka are logical units that consist of multiple consumers that share the same topic name.
- When multiple consumers belong to the same group, Kafka's message broker assigns a message broker and creates cloned copies of messages for the group.
- Each consumer within the group processes its assigned copy of the message.
- Grouping consumers allows for load balancing and parallel processing of messages from a topic.
- Consumers within the same group coordinate with each other to ensure that each message is processed by only one consumer within the group.

**Example:**

- In the provided example, the group is specified as `abc`, and there are 5 consumers using the same topic name `TEST-A`.
- The Kafka message broker allocates a specific Message Broker (MessageBroker-5) for this group and creates 5 Message Replicas (MR) of the actual message from the topic `TEST-A`.
- Each consumer within the group processes one of the MR copies, ensuring that each message is consumed by only one consumer.

**Conclusion:**

In Apache Kafka, topics are used to organize and store messages. Kafka follows a publish/subscribe model, where messages are published to topics and consumed by subscribing consumers. The creation of a topic can be done using `TopicBuilder` or dynamically by the `KafkaTemplate`. Groups in Kafka allow multiple consumers to share the same topic and coordinate the processing of messages. By understanding topics and groups in Kafka, developers can design scalable and fault-tolerant messaging systems.

**ProducerRecord in Kafka:**

- When the `send` method of `KafkaTemplate` is called to publish a message, the Kafka API creates a `ProducerRecord` object internally.
- The `ProducerRecord` class represents a single message to be sent to a topic in Kafka.
- It contains the topic name, key, value, and optionally partition, timestamp, and headers.
- The data is serialized before being sent to Kafka.

Example:
```java
ProducerRecord<K, V> producerRecord = new ProducerRecord<>(topic, data);
```

**ConsumerRecord in Kafka:**

- The `@KafkaListener` annotation is used to define a method that reads data from a given topic into a `ConsumerRecord` object.
- The `ConsumerRecord` class represents a single message consumed from a topic in Kafka.
- It contains the topic name, partition, offset, key, value, and timestamp.
- The data is deserialized from its binary format.

Example:
```java
ConsumerRecord<K, V> consumerRecord = new ConsumerRecord<>(topic, data);
```

**Data Format in Kafka:**

- Internally, the data format in Kafka is binary (byte[]), which makes it efficient for transfer and storage.
- The serialization and deserialization of data are handled by the configured serializers and deserializers in Kafka.

**Consuming from Multiple Topics:**

- A single consumer can read data from multiple topics by specifying them in the `@KafkaListener` annotation.
- The topics are defined as an array of topic names.
- This allows for consolidated consumption of data from multiple topics within a single consumer.

Example:
```java
@KafkaListener(topics = {
           "${my.topic.name2}",
	   "${my.topic.name1}",
	   "${my.topic.name3}"
         },
	groupId = "abcd")
```

**Spring Kafka's MessagingMessageListenerAdapter:**

- Spring with Kafka uses the `MessagingMessageListenerAdapter` class as the listener for reading data from the Kafka broker.
- It is responsible for receiving the data from Kafka and converting it into a format that can be processed by the listener method.
- The `MessagingMessageListenerAdapter` provides flexibility in message conversion by supporting various message converters.

**Connection with Kafka Server and ZooKeeper:**

- The application is connected to a Kafka server that runs on port 9092.
- Kafka uses ZooKeeper for distributed coordination and configuration management.
- ZooKeeper runs on port 2181 by default.

**Gateway in Microservices Architecture:**

- A gateway serves as a single entry and exit point for the entire microservices application.
- It exposes a single IP/PORT for external clients to interact with the microservices.
- It acts as a load balancer, distributing incoming requests to different microservices instances.
- The gateway is connected with consumer applications (such as Angular, ReactJS, or 3rd-party clients) and handles routing requests to appropriate microservices based on a routing table or rules.

Example:
- For the given URLs:
  - `http://sampleapp.com/user/find/101`
  - `http://sampleapp.com/cart/modify/106`
- The gateway would receive these requests and route them to the corresponding microservices responsible for handling user-related operations and cart modifications.

**Conclusion:**

Understanding the internals of Kafka, such as `ProducerRecord` and `ConsumerRecord`, helps in working with the data transfer and serialization process. Spring Kafka's `MessagingMessageListenerAdapter` simplifies the conversion of Kafka messages to a format suitable for processing. Additionally, being connected to a Kafka server running on port 9092 and ZooKeeper running on port 2181 ensures the proper functioning of the Kafka-based application. In a microservices architecture, a gateway acts as a central
