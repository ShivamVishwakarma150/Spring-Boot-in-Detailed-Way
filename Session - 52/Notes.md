# Application Design : Layers Concept

1. Repository Class:
   - Repository classes are responsible for handling database operations in an application.
   - They provide an abstraction layer between the application and the database, allowing the application to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the underlying data store.
   - Repository classes typically use frameworks such as Spring Data JPA to simplify database operations by providing predefined methods for common database actions.

2. Service Class:
   - Service classes contain the business logic and perform calculations or operations required by the application.
   - They handle complex business rules and orchestrate interactions between different components of the application.
   - Service classes can also manage transactional behavior, ensuring data consistency and integrity during database operations.
   - By separating business logic into service classes, it becomes easier to test and maintain the codebase.

3. Controller Class:
   - Controller classes are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and returning appropriate responses.
   - They act as an entry point for user interactions and delegate the processing to the appropriate service or component.
   - Controller classes handle request mapping, data validation, and preparing the response, such as rendering views or returning JSON data.
   - In the context of Spring Boot, controller classes are typically annotated with `@Controller` or `@RestController` to define request mappings and handle specific URLs or API endpoints.

4. Entity Class:
   - Entity classes represent the data model of the application and map to database tables.
   - They encapsulate the structure and properties of the data stored in the database.
   - Entity classes are usually annotated with frameworks such as JPA annotations (`@Entity`, `@Table`, etc.) to define the mapping between the class and the corresponding table.
   - These classes are used to perform database operations and interact with the repository layer.

5. Util Class:
   - Util classes are used to write common or generic logic that can be reused across different parts of the application.
   - They often contain utility methods, helper functions, or static methods that perform specific tasks.
   - Util classes can encapsulate commonly used functionalities, such as date formatting, string manipulation, encryption, or validation logic.
   - These classes promote code reusability and help maintain a modular and organized codebase.

It's important to note that the layers mentioned (Repository, Service, Controller) are the standard layers used in the three-layer architecture for developing web applications. Each layer has a specific responsibility and contributes to a well-structured and maintainable codebase.

In the context of a simple web application developed using Spring Boot, the recommended layers are:

1. Presentation Layer (PL):
   - Implemented using Spring Boot Web MVC.
   - This layer is responsible for handling HTTP requests, managing user interactions, and displaying data to the user.
   - It includes the controller classes that handle request processing, data validation, and rendering views or returning JSON responses.

2. Service Layer (SL):
   - This layer contains the business logic and performs calculations or operations required by the application.
   - It encapsulates complex business rules and coordinates interactions between different components of the application.
   - Service classes may also handle transaction management to ensure data consistency and integrity during database operations.

3. Data Access Layer (DAL):
   - This layer is responsible for handling database operations.
   - It includes repository classes that define CRUD operations and interact with the underlying data store.
   - The repository classes utilize frameworks like Spring Data JPA to simplify database operations.

By structuring the application into these layers, developers can achieve better separation of concerns, modularize the codebase, improve code readability and maintainability, and facilitate easier testing and debugging.

It's important to note that Spring Boot MVC, Entity classes, and Util classes are not layers themselves. Spring Boot MVC is a framework used in the Presentation Layer to handle web requests, Entity classes represent the data model used in the application, and Util classes contain common or reusable logic that can be used across different layers of the application.

## **Q) What are Java relations used in Layers Connection?** 

A) In the context of layer-based architecture in Java applications, two types of relationships are commonly used:

1. HAS-A Relationship:
   - The HAS-A relationship represents a composition or aggregation relationship between classes, indicating that one class has a reference to another class as a member or attribute.
   - In the context of layer connections, the HAS-A relationship is often established using dependency injection.
   - In Spring applications, the `@Autowired` annotation is commonly used for dependency injection, where one layer has a dependency on another layer.
   - For example, a Service class may have a dependency on a Repository class to perform database operations. By using the `@Autowired` annotation, the dependency can be automatically injected into the Service class.

2. IS-A Relationship:
   - The IS-A relationship represents inheritance between classes, indicating that one class is a specialized version or subtype of another class.
   - In the context of layer connections, the IS-A relationship is used to establish a hierarchy within a layer.
   - For example, a Service class may extend a base Service class or implement an interface to inherit common functionality or define specific behaviors.
   - By utilizing the IS-A relationship, classes within the same layer can inherit or implement common methods or contracts, promoting code reuse and consistency.

It's important to note that these relationships are used to establish connections and dependencies between classes within and across layers, facilitating collaboration and communication between different parts of the application.


<br/>
<br/>

The layer-based design approach is often used to develop applications using a modular concept. Each module represents a distinct set of features or functionality within the application. By organizing the application into modules, it becomes easier to understand, develop, test, and maintain the application.

Taking the examples you mentioned:

1. Amazon App:
   - The Amazon App can be divided into modules such as Search, Cart, Payment, Feedback, Tracking, and more.
   - Each module focuses on a specific aspect of the application and handles related functionality.
   - For example, the Search module allows users to search for products, the Cart module manages the user's shopping cart, the Payment module handles payment processing, and so on.
   - Each module may have its own set of layers (Presentation Layer, Service Layer, Data Access Layer) to handle the respective functionality.

2. Gmail App:
   - The Gmail App can be divided into modules such as User (Register, Login), Inbox, Sent, and more.
   - The User module handles user-related functionality such as user registration and login.
   - The Inbox and Sent modules handle email-related functionality, such as displaying incoming emails and managing sent emails.
   - Each module may have its own set of layers (Presentation Layer, Service Layer, Data Access Layer) to handle the respective functionality.

3. Facebook App:
   - The Facebook App can be divided into modules such as User (Register, Login), Feed, Messaging, Notifications, and more.
   - The User module handles user-related functionality, including registration and login.
   - The Feed module focuses on displaying and interacting with the user's news feed.
   - The Messaging module handles the sending and receiving of messages between users.
   - Each module may have its own set of layers (Presentation Layer, Service Layer, Data Access Layer) to handle the respective functionality.

By dividing the application into modules, developers can work on different parts of the application independently, promoting code reusability, maintainability, and scalability. Each module can have its own set of layers, encapsulating the specific logic and ensuring separation of concerns.

```txt
    *) For One Module, different code files are:
    a. Entity
    b. Repository Interface
    c. Service Interface
    d. Service Impl class
    e. Util class
    f. Controller class
    ex:
    a. EmployeeEntity
    b. EmployeeRepository 
    c. IEmployeeService 
    d. EmployeeServiceImpl
    e. EmployeeUtil
    f. EmployeeController 
```

In a module-based architecture, different code files are typically used to represent different components of a module. Here is a breakdown of the common code files used for a module:

a. Entity:
   - The Entity class represents the data model or structure of the entity within the module.
   - It typically corresponds to a database table or a data object in the application.
   - In your example, the `EmployeeEntity` class would define the attributes and behavior related to an employee.

b. Repository Interface:
   - The Repository interface defines the contract for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data stored in a persistent storage system, such as a database.
   - It provides the methods to interact with the data and encapsulates the underlying data access logic.
   - In your example, the `EmployeeRepository` interface would specify the methods for CRUD operations on the employee data.

c. Service Interface:
   - The Service interface defines the contract for the business logic and operations related to the module.
   - It acts as an abstraction layer between the repository and the presentation layer.
   - In your example, the `IEmployeeService` interface would define methods for performing operations on employees, such as creating, updating, deleting, or retrieving employee data.

d. Service Implementation Class:
   - The Service implementation class provides the actual implementation of the methods defined in the Service interface.
   - It contains the business logic and performs operations by utilizing the repository and other necessary components.
   - In your example, the `EmployeeServiceImpl` class would implement the methods defined in the `IEmployeeService` interface and handle the employee-related operations.

e. Util Class:
   - The Util class contains common or utility methods that are used across the module.
   - It typically includes helper methods, formatting functions, or any other shared logic.
   - In your example, the `EmployeeUtil` class would contain utility methods related to employee operations, such as data validation, formatting, or conversion.

f. Controller Class:
   - The Controller class handles the incoming requests from the presentation layer, processes them, and returns the appropriate response.
   - It interacts with the Service layer to perform the necessary operations and prepares the response to be sent back to the client.
   - In your example, the `EmployeeController` class would handle the HTTP requests related to employee operations, such as creating, updating, deleting, or retrieving employee data.

By organizing the code into these different files, it promotes separation of concerns, modularization, and code reusability. Each file has a specific responsibility and plays a crucial role in implementing the functionality of the module.

# Struts F/w Design

Struts Framework Design involves several components that work together to handle web requests and perform various operations. Here is an overview of the key components in Struts Framework design:

1. DTO (Data Transfer Object):
   - The DTO represents the data exchanged between the presentation layer (web form) and the server-side components.
   - It encapsulates the data submitted by the user in a single object, often referred to as a Form Object.
   - The DTO holds the data temporarily until it is transferred to the server-side for further processing.

2. BO/VO (Business Object/Value Object):
   - The BO (Business Object) or VO (Value Object) represents the business domain object that encapsulates the business logic and data operations.
   - It is responsible for handling the business rules, performing validations, and coordinating data operations.
   - The BO/VO is often derived from the DTO and used by the service layer to perform operations related to the business domain.

3. Mapper:
   - The Mapper component is responsible for converting the DTO (Data Transfer Object) to BO (Business Object) and BO to VO (Value Object).
   - It acts as a bridge between the layers and handles the transformation of data structures.
   - The Mapper ensures that the data is correctly converted and mapped between the different layers of the application.

By utilizing a Mapper component, the data flow and transformation between DTO, BO, and VO become streamlined and consistent. It helps maintain separation of concerns and improves code readability and maintainability.

It's important to note that the Struts Framework is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. The DTO, BO/VO, and Mapper components play a crucial role in the Model layer, where the business logic and data operations are implemented. The Controller (Action classes) handle the request processing, while the View (JSP pages) is responsible for rendering the user interface.

Overall, the Struts Framework design emphasizes the separation of concerns and provides a structured approach for building web applications by utilizing DTOs, BOs/VOs, and a Mapper component to handle data transformation and business logic operations.

```

These code files represent a basic implementation of the "Student" module in a Spring application. The module includes an entity (StudentEntity), a repository (StudentRepository), a service interface (StudentService), a service implementation (StudentServiceImpl), a data transfer object (StudentDTO), and a controller (StudentController). These files work together to handle CRUD operations for student data.

Here's a code-wise explanation for the code files related to the "Student" module in a Spring application:

1. StudentEntity.java:
   - This class represents the entity for a student. It is annotated with `@Entity` to indicate that it is a JPA entity.
   - It has fields such as `id`, `firstName`, and `lastName`, which correspond to the database columns.
   - The `@Id` annotation specifies the primary key field, and `@GeneratedValue` indicates that the ID is automatically generated.

2. StudentRepository.java:
   - This interface extends the `JpaRepository` interface, which provides CRUD operations for the `StudentEntity` class.
   - It allows you to perform database operations on the `StudentEntity` objects using methods such as `save()`, `findById()`, and `findAll()`.

3. StudentService.java:
   - This interface defines the contract for the student service, specifying methods for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving students.
   - It declares methods such as `createStudent()`, `updateStudent()`, `deleteStudent()`, `getStudentById()`, and `getAllStudents()`.

4. StudentServiceImpl.java:
   - This class implements the `StudentService` interface and provides the actual implementation for the student-related operations.
   - It uses the `StudentRepository` for interacting with the database.
   - The methods like `createStudent()`, `updateStudent()`, `deleteStudent()`, `getStudentById()`, and `getAllStudents()` are implemented here.
   - In these methods, the service performs the necessary business logic and uses the repository to persist or retrieve data.

5. StudentDTO.java:
   - This class represents the data transfer object (DTO) for a student. It contains fields like `id`, `firstName`, and `lastName`.
   - The DTO is used for transferring data between different layers of the application, such as the controller and service layers.

6. StudentController.java:
   - This class acts as the controller for handling HTTP requests related to students.
   - It is annotated with `@RestController` to indicate that it is a RESTful controller.
   - The `@RequestMapping` annotation specifies the base URL mapping for the controller.
   - It defines methods for handling HTTP POST, PUT, DELETE, and GET requests.
   - The methods delegate the request handling to the `StudentService` by calling the appropriate service methods.
   - The methods return appropriate `ResponseEntity` objects with the response data and HTTP status codes.

These code files work together to implement the "Student" module in a Spring application. The entity represents the student's data structure, the repository provides database operations, the service defines the business logic, the DTO facilitates data transfer, and the controller handles incoming HTTP requests and interacts with the service layer.
