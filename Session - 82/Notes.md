**Monolithic Application:**

A monolithic application is a type of software architecture where all the components or modules of an application are tightly coupled and deployed as a single unit. In a monolithic application, all the services and functionalities are packaged together into a single deployable component, such as a single WAR (Web Archive) file or a JAR (Java Archive) file. 

In a monolithic architecture, the entire application runs as a single process and communicates internally through function calls or shared memory. This means that all the services within the application are dependent on each other and any changes or updates to one service require the entire application to be redeployed.

Monolithic applications are typically characterized by their simplicity and ease of development, as all the services are developed together and share the same codebase. However, as the application grows in size and complexity, maintaining and scaling a monolithic application can become challenging.

**Life Cycle of a Monolithic Application:**

1. **Plan**: In the planning phase, the requirements and scope of the application are defined. This involves identifying the services or functionalities that need to be included in the monolithic application.

2. **Code**: The development phase involves writing the code for all the services and functionalities of the application. In a monolithic architecture, all the code is written and organized within a single codebase.

3. **Build**: The build phase involves compiling and packaging the code into a deployable unit, such as a WAR or JAR file. This step may also include any necessary configuration or resource setup.

4. **Deploy**: In the deployment phase, the monolithic application is deployed onto a server or hosting environment. The entire application, including all its services, is deployed as a single unit.

5. **Monitor**: Once the application is deployed, it is monitored for performance, availability, and any issues that may arise. Monitoring tools and techniques are used to track the health and performance of the monolithic application.

**JDK (Java Development Kit) Software:**

The JDK software is the software package provided by Oracle (previously Sun Microsystems) that includes the necessary tools, libraries, and components for developing, compiling, and running Java applications. The JDK software is platform-dependent, which means that different versions of the JDK are available for different operating systems.

For example, there are separate JDK versions for Linux, Windows, macOS, and other operating systems. Each JDK version is specifically tailored for the respective operating system to ensure compatibility and optimal performance.

The JDK software provides the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which is required to run Java applications, along with additional development tools such as the Java compiler (`javac`), debugger (`jdb`), and other utilities.

It's important to choose the appropriate JDK version based on the operating system on which the Java application will be deployed. The JDK software provides the necessary runtime and development environment for Java applications, enabling developers to write and execute Java code across different platforms.
