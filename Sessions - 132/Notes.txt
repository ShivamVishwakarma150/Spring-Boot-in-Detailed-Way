				    Docker

1. To Run our application in any environment we need softwares
and dependencies like: JRE/Java, Tomcat Server, MySQL Database
Jars/Dependncies, Cache Server, ..etc

2. Environment can be : Linux, Windows Server, MAC OS ..etc

3. Softwares and application dependencies are OS Dependent.

4. To make them OS Independent, we use Virtual OS concept ie Docker

5. Docker works based on Images and Containers.

Image : Software/Application in packed format with dependencies.
Containers : if we run Image, then it is called as Container.

6. We can create our application image by using Dockerfile(info)
   and build it.

7. We can push into docker hub (repository) to store and share images
   to other dev/prod/qa environments.

8. We can pull images and run using docker in any environment.

9. Task by Dev:
Code
create Dockerfile
Create Docker Image (build)
Run Docker image (Container)
Create Docker Tag (username/image)
Push the tag -> hub
Pull From Hub
