			  SOLID

SRP: "A class should have one, and only one, reason to change"
(We need to follow this)


OCP: "You should be able to extend a classâ€™s behavior, without modifying it"
(Supported by Java) Inheritance and Override


LSP: "Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes."
(Supported by Java)  Up-casting


ISP: "Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific."
(We need to implement) - Define multiple interfaces with specific operations
  instead of writing all in one.

DIP: "Depend on abstractions, not on concretions."
(We need to implement) -
create HAS-A Relation between class and interface/abstract class
not between two classes.
