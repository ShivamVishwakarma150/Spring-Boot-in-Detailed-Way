			  Message Queues (MQs)

*) The continuous data flow between two systems. Producer will send data
   and consumer will read by using a connector/mediator ie 'Message Broker'

*) Client-Server applications works using HTTP protocol. 
   There client has to make request then server will process it and
   gives response back to client.

*) But here, one time connection between producer-consumer is made using
  Message broker, then continuous data flow is done. Consumer need not
  to make request again and again. one time connection is fine.

*)MQs usecases:
1. Swiggy Delivery 
2. Ola/Uber cab status
3. Live Train status 
4. Live Stock Market data
5. Live Currency Updates
6. Live Cricket Score (BCCI server-> ESPN, CricBuzz,XYZ Server)
..etc

*) MQs concept uses TCP protocol to exchange data.
========================================================================
1. Basic MQs (single broker - No LoadBalancer)
JMS : Java Message Service / Apache ActiveMQ 

2. Advanced MQs (Multi Broker - LoadBalancer)
Apache Kafka***


*) One MOM (Message Oriented Middleware) is used to connect two systems
 [Producer and Consumer]

*) MOM s/w contains destination, it is a memory that holds messages
  given by Producer and sent to Consumer.

*) Here, Both Producer and Consumer systems are connected using
  one common destination only. ie Destination name given at consumer
  must match with destination name given at producer.

*) There is no direct connection is created between producer and consumer
  ie NO IP/PORT details shared.

*) There are two types of communications. Given as:
1. Peer-To-Peer Communication [P2P]
If one message is given to one Consumer, then it is called as P2P.
In this case Destination type is known as : Queue.

2. Publish-Subscribe Communication [Pub/Sub]
If one message is given to Multiple Consumers (cloned copied)
then it is called as Pub/Sub.

In this case Destination type is known as : Topic.

*)Note:
1. There can be multiple topics, queues are created with unique names.
2. Both P2P and Pub/Sub are used in realtime.
