*)SQL Joins:-
 Fetching data from multiple table using one SQL query.
 Table must be connected (PK-FK).
 We need at least two tables to fetch data(at max many).

-> SelfJoin, CrossJoin, EqualJoin
** Inner Join | Join  (Word Inner is Optional)
** Outer Join (3)
   -> LEFT OUTER JOIN  | LEFT JOIN  (Word Outer is Optional)
   -> RIGHT OUTER JOIN | RIGHT JOIN
   -> FULL OUTER JOIN  | FULL JOIN  (Few DBs may not support this)
=======================================================================
1. Output
INNER JOIN : Only Connected Rows from both tables are selected.
LEFT JOIN  : All rows from Leftside table and connected rows  from rightside table are selected.
RIGHT JOIN  : All rows from Rightside table and connected rows  from leftside table are selected.
FULL JOIN  : All Rows (Connected and NonConnected) rows from both tables are selected.

2. SQL Syntax | Examples

SELECT <P>.<column>, <C>.<column>

FROM ParentTable <P>
      [JOIN TYPE]
     ChildTable <C>

ON <P>.<PK> = <C>.<CK>

WHERE <condition>
---------------------------------------------
Examples#
       prodtab    *...1    vendortab
    pid pcode vidFk        vid  vname

SELECT p.pcode, v.vname
FROM prodtab p
    left outer join
    vendortab v
ON p.vidFk = v.vid
--------------------------------------------------------------
           1....*
       book ---------- author
 bid bname bcost    aid aname bidFk

Q) Fetch Books which are having authors? [Only Connected rows] 
  Print only Book Name and Author name

SELECT b.bname, a.aname
FROM book b
   INNER JOIN
    author a
ON b.bid = a.bidFk


Q) Fetch All Books and their authors if exist?

Q) Fetch All Authors and their books if exist?
