**Agile Method:**
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. It emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement throughout the development process. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, promote adaptive planning, early delivery, and rapid feedback to accommodate changing requirements and deliver value to customers. Here are some key terms and concepts related to Agile:

- **Product Owner (PO):** The Product Owner represents the stakeholders and acts as the voice of the customer. They are responsible for defining and prioritizing the product backlog, ensuring that the development team works on the most valuable features, and making decisions regarding the product's direction.

- **Business Analyst (BA):** The Business Analyst works closely with stakeholders to gather and analyze requirements, identify business needs, and help in the development of the product. They bridge the gap between business objectives and technical implementation.

- **Epic:** An Epic is a large body of work that cannot be completed in a single iteration or sprint. It represents a high-level user story or project document that needs to be broken down into smaller, more manageable stories for implementation.

- **Story:** A Story represents a specific piece of work that needs to be done. It is typically a user-centric requirement or feature that adds value to the product. Stories are usually smaller than Epics and are implemented within a single sprint.

- **Acceptance Criteria:** Acceptance Criteria are a set of conditions or requirements that must be met for a story to be considered complete and accepted by the Product Owner. They help to define the expected behavior and outcomes of the story and guide the development process.

- **Effort Estimation Time (EET) Story Points:** Story Points are a relative measure of the effort required to implement a story. They are used for estimating the time and complexity of stories. The EET in Story Points helps in planning the capacity of the team and determining the number of stories that can be completed within a given sprint.

- **Product Backlog (PB):** The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of all the stories, epics, bugs, and tasks that need to be implemented in the product. It serves as the source of work for the development team and is continuously updated and refined based on the evolving needs of the product.

**Scrum Team and Roles:**
In Agile, a Scrum Team is a group of individuals responsible for delivering the product. The team includes developers, testers, designers, and other roles as necessary. Here are some key roles in a Scrum Team:

- **Scrum Master:** The Scrum Master is responsible for facilitating the Scrum process, ensuring that the team follows Agile principles and practices, and removing any obstacles or impediments that may hinder the team's progress. They act as a servant leader and help the team to be self-organizing and productive.

**Sprint:**
A Sprint is a fixed time-boxed iteration within Agile development. It is a time-bound milestone during which a set of stories and tasks are planned, executed, and delivered. Sprints are usually of 2 weeks to 1-month duration, and their length is determined by the team's capacity and the project's requirements.

- **Sprint Planning:** Sprint Planning is a collaborative session where the Scrum Team determines the stories and tasks to be worked on during the upcoming sprint. The team estimates the effort required for each story and identifies the tasks necessary for implementation.

- **Sprint Execution:** Once the sprint planning is complete, the development team starts working on the identified stories and tasks. Daily stand-up meetings are held to provide updates on progress, discuss any challenges or blockers, and ensure smooth collaboration within the team.

- **Sprint Retrospective:** At the end of each sprint, a retrospective meeting is conducted to reflect on the sprint's outcomes, discuss what went well, what could be improved, and identify any learnings or changes to be implemented in the next sprint. The retrospective helps the team to continuously improve and optimize their development process.

**Story Life Cycle:**
In Agile, stories go through different stages during their lifecycle. Here are the typical stages:

- **Open:** The story is accepted and ready to be implemented, but the work has not yet started.

- **In-Progress:** The development team has started coding and implementing the story.

- **Resolved:** The coding work is completed, and the story has progressed to the stage of testing and validation in staging or QA environments.

- **Closed:** The story has been fully tested and is considered complete. It has met the acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment.

**Bug Life Cycle:**
In Agile, bugs or issues in the application also go through specific stages:

- **Open:** The bug is accepted and needs to be fixed by the development team.

- **Fixing:** The development team starts working on fixing the bug.

- **Fixed:** The bug is fixed by the development team, and the fix has been validated.

- **Closed:** The bug has been fully tested, and it is considered resolved.

- **Rejected:** The reported bug is determined to be a duplicate or not relevant to the current work and is marked as rejected.

**Issue Types:**
Different types of issues or work items are tracked in Agile development. Here are some common types:

- **Epic:** An Epic represents a full and final product or project document that captures a significant body of work. It serves as a container for related stories and provides a higher-level view of the project's scope.

- **Story:** A Story represents a specific piece of work or a user requirement that adds value to the product. It is typically a smaller, more granular unit of work that can be implemented within a single sprint.

- **Bug:** A Bug represents an issue or problem identified in the application that needs to be fixed. It is typically reported by the Quality Assurance (QA) team during testing.

- **Task:** A Task represents a smaller piece of work that can be derived from a story. It is used to break down stories into more manageable units and assign them to team members for implementation.

- **Sub Task:** A Sub Task represents a further breakdown of a task into smaller parts. It helps in organizing and tracking progress within a larger task.

By understanding these concepts and roles in Agile development, teams can effectively plan, execute, and deliver software products in an iterative and collaborative manner, ensuring customer satisfaction and adaptability to changing requirements.
