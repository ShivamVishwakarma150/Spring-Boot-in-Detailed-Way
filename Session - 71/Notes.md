**1. Node:**
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. To download and install Node.js, you can visit the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and click on the download link suitable for your operating system. After installing Node.js, you can verify the installation by opening a command prompt or terminal and running the following commands:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
npx -v
```
- `node -v` displays the installed version of Node.js.
- `npm -v` displays the installed version of npm (Node Package Manager).
- `npx -v` displays the installed version of npx (Node Package Runner).

These commands ensure that Node.js and its related tools are installed correctly.

**2. VS Code Editor:**
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular source code editor that provides a rich and customizable environment for web development. You can download and install VS Code from the official website (https://code.visualstudio.com/download). After downloading, follow the installation instructions and complete the installation process.

Once installed, you can open VS Code and create a new folder for your frontend applications.

**3. Angular Setup:**
Angular is a popular JavaScript framework for building web applications. To set up Angular, follow these steps:

- Open the terminal in VS Code.
- Run the following commands:
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng version
```
- The first command installs the Angular CLI globally on your system.
- The second command checks the installed version of Angular CLI to verify the successful installation.

**4. Application Creation (Angular):**
After setting up Angular, you can create a new Angular application using the Angular CLI. Here's how you can do it:

- In the terminal, navigate to the folder where you want to create the application.
- Run the following command:
```bash
ng new student-ang-app
```
- When prompted, select 'Yes' to enable routing and choose the preferred stylesheet format (CSS in this case).
- Once the command completes, navigate into the created project directory using the following command:
```bash
cd student-ang-app
```

**5. Start Angular Application:**
To start the Angular application and see it in the browser, follow these steps:

- In the terminal (still inside the project directory), run the following command:
```bash
ng serve --open
```
- The `ng serve` command builds the application and starts the development server.
- The `--open` flag automatically opens the application in the default browser.

You should see the default Angular application running at `http://localhost:4200`.

**6. ReactJS Setup:**
ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. To set up ReactJS, follow these steps:

- Uninstall the global `create-react-app` package (if installed) by running the following command:
```bash
npm uninstall -g create-react-app
```
- Clear the npm cache for `npx` by running the following command:
```bash
npx clear-npx-cache
```
- Install the latest version of `create-react-app` by running the following command:
```bash
npm i create-react-app
```

**7. Application Creation (ReactJS):**
After setting up ReactJS, you can create a new React application using `create-react-app`. Here's how you can do it:

- In the terminal, navigate to the folder where you want to create the application.
- Run the following command:
```bash
npx create-react-app@

latest student-rjs-app
```
- This command creates a new React application named `student-rjs-app` using the latest version of `create-react-app`.
- Once the command completes, navigate into the created project directory using the following command:
```bash
cd student-rjs-app
```

**8. Start ReactJS Application:**
To start the ReactJS application and see it in the browser, follow these steps:

- In the terminal (still inside the project directory), run the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
- The `npm start` command builds the application and starts the development server.
- You should see the default ReactJS application running at `http://localhost:3000`.

**Conclusion:**
In this process, we have set up the required tools and created a basic Angular and ReactJS application. These steps ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed and can start building frontend applications using Angular and ReactJS. From here, you can continue exploring and developing your applications using these frameworks.
