In JPA (Java Persistence API), generators are used to automatically generate primary key values for entities during the save/INSERT operation. This helps in maintaining the uniqueness and integrity of the data in the database. There are two types of generators available in JPA: **pre-defined generators** and **custom generators**. Let's explore each point in detail:

1. **Generate one Primary Key (ID) value on save/INSERT operation**:
   When an entity is persisted or saved into the database, it is required to have a unique identifier, typically referred to as the primary key (ID). Rather than manually assigning a value to the primary key, JPA provides the ability to automatically generate it during the save operation. This eliminates the need for manual intervention and ensures that each entity has a unique identifier.

2. **Pre-defined Generators**:
   JPA offers several pre-defined generators that can be used to generate primary key values. These generators are provided as part of the JPA specification and can be configured using annotations or XML mappings. Some of the commonly used pre-defined generators are:
   - **AUTO**: The persistence provider chooses an appropriate generator based on the database capabilities. It may use identity columns, sequence objects, or table-based generators.
   - **IDENTITY**: Uses database identity columns to generate primary key values. The database assigns a unique value to the identity column during the INSERT operation.
   - **SEQUENCE**: Uses database sequences to generate primary key values. Sequences are independent database objects that generate a unique sequence of numbers.
   - **TABLE**: Utilizes a separate database table to generate primary key values. The table contains a single row and a column to store the current value of the primary key.

3. **Custom Generators**:
   In addition to the pre-defined generators, JPA allows you to create custom generators to generate primary key values according to your specific requirements. Custom generators can be implemented by extending the `org.hibernate.id.IdentifierGenerator` class or by implementing the `javax.persistence.GeneratedValue` annotation and providing a custom generator class. This gives you the flexibility to define your own logic for generating primary keys, such as using UUIDs, composite keys, or any other custom algorithm.

Overall, generators in JPA provide a convenient way to automatically generate primary key values during the save/INSERT operation. Pre-defined generators offer a set of commonly used strategies, while custom generators allow you to implement custom logic for generating primary keys. Choosing the appropriate generator depends on the specific needs of your application and the capabilities of your database.

# **Q) What are Generators in Realtime ?**<br/>

In real-time applications, generators refer to the mechanisms or processes used to assign unique identifiers or generate values for various entities or objects. These generated values serve as unique identifiers or keys for distinguishing individual instances of those entities. The purpose of using generators is to ensure data integrity, uniqueness, and proper identification within the application.

Here are a few examples of generators in real-time applications:

1. **Student Roll Number Generator**: In an educational institution, a generator may be implemented to assign unique roll numbers to students. The generator could follow a specific format or algorithm to generate roll numbers based on the student's information, such as the year of admission, department code, and a sequential number.

2. **Bank Account Number Generator**: When a new bank account is created for a customer, a generator is used to assign a unique account number. The generator may consider factors like the bank branch code, account type, and a sequential number to generate a unique account number.

3. **Person's PAN Card Number and Aadhar ID Generator**: Government identification numbers like PAN card numbers and Aadhar IDs are generated using specific algorithms that incorporate various factors such as date of birth, location, and other personal information. These generators ensure that each individual is assigned a unique identification number.

Generators in real-time applications play a crucial role in maintaining the uniqueness and integrity of the data. They eliminate the need for manual assignment of identifiers, reduce the possibility of duplication, and provide a systematic approach for generating unique values based on certain rules or algorithms.

It's important to note that the implementation of generators may vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of each application. The generated values are typically stored alongside other relevant data in databases or systems to ensure proper identification and retrieval of information.

# Let's delve into each point you mentioned and provide a detailed explanation of each:

1. `@GeneratedValue` annotation is used with `GenerationType` enum:
   The `@GeneratedValue` annotation is used in JPA to indicate that the value for a specific field (typically a primary key) should be automatically generated. It is used in conjunction with the `GenerationType` enum, which specifies the strategy for generating the values. By applying this annotation, the JPA provider will automatically generate the value based on the specified strategy.

2. `SEQUENCE` is mostly used for Oracle databases:
   The `SEQUENCE` generation strategy is commonly used in Oracle databases. A sequence in Oracle is a database object that generates a unique sequence of numbers. When `SEQUENCE` is used as the generation strategy, the JPA provider retrieves the next value from the specified sequence and assigns it to the annotated field. This ensures the uniqueness of generated values across different entities and transactions.

3. `IDENTITY` is used for MySQL (Auto-Increment):
   The `IDENTITY` generation strategy is commonly used in MySQL databases. When `IDENTITY` is used, the database assigns an auto-incrementing value to the annotated field during the insertion of a new row. This means that the database itself generates and manages the values for the primary key, ensuring uniqueness and sequential ordering.

4. `TABLE`: A table is created (behaves like a sequence) and stores the ID value:
   The `TABLE` generation strategy involves creating a separate database table to generate primary key values. This strategy creates a table with a single row and a column to store the current value of the primary key. The JPA provider manages this table and increments the value in it whenever a new entity is persisted. The assigned value is then used as the primary key for the new entity.

5. `AUTO`: Any one option is selected based on the DB:
   The `AUTO` generation strategy allows the JPA provider to choose the appropriate strategy based on the capabilities of the underlying database. It may use `IDENTITY`, `SEQUENCE`, or `TABLE` depending on the database in use. This strategy provides flexibility and allows for seamless integration with different databases without requiring explicit configuration.

By understanding these points, you have gained insight into the various options available for generating primary key values in JPA. The `@GeneratedValue` annotation, along with the `GenerationType` enum, offers flexibility in choosing the appropriate strategy based on the specific requirements and the database being used. It is important to consider the database capabilities and constraints when selecting the generation strategy to ensure the integrity and uniqueness of the generated values.

<br/>

# Here are some code snippets to illustrate the usage of different generation strategies in JPA:

1. `@GeneratedValue` annotation with `GenerationType.AUTO`:
   ```java
   @Entity
   public class Employee {
       @Id
       @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
       private Long id;
       // other fields and getters/setters
   }
   ```
   In this example, the `@GeneratedValue` annotation is used with the `GenerationType.AUTO` strategy. The JPA provider will automatically select an appropriate strategy based on the database capabilities. It may use `IDENTITY`, `SEQUENCE`, or `TABLE` depending on the underlying database.

2. `@GeneratedValue` annotation with `GenerationType.IDENTITY` (MySQL auto-increment):
   ```java
   @Entity
   public class Book {
       @Id
       @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
       private Long id;
       // other fields and getters/setters
   }
   ```
   In this example, the `GenerationType.IDENTITY` strategy is used. It is commonly used in databases like MySQL that support auto-increment columns. The database itself generates and manages the values for the primary key, ensuring uniqueness and sequential ordering.

3. `@GeneratedValue` annotation with `GenerationType.SEQUENCE` (Oracle sequence):
   ```java
   @Entity
   @SequenceGenerator(name = "book_seq", sequenceName = "BOOK_SEQ", allocationSize = 1)
   public class Book {
       @Id
       @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = "book_seq")
       private Long id;
       // other fields and getters/setters
   }
   ```
   In this example, the `GenerationType.SEQUENCE` strategy is used with an explicitly defined sequence generator. The `@SequenceGenerator` annotation is used to specify the name of the sequence and its allocation size. The JPA provider retrieves the next value from the sequence and assigns it to the `id` field.

4. `@GeneratedValue` annotation with `GenerationType.TABLE`:
   ```java
   @Entity
   @TableGenerator(name = "book_gen", table = "ID_GEN", pkColumnName = "GEN_NAME", valueColumnName = "GEN_VALUE", allocationSize = 1)
   public class Book {
       @Id
       @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.TABLE, generator = "book_gen")
       private Long id;
       // other fields and getters/setters
   }
   ```
   In this example, the `GenerationType.TABLE` strategy is used. A separate table named `ID_GEN` is created to store the current value of the primary key. The `@TableGenerator` annotation is used to specify the details of the table generator, including the names of the columns used to store the generator name and the current value.

These code snippets demonstrate the usage of different generation strategies in JPA. The specific annotations and configurations provide instructions to the JPA provider on how to generate and manage the primary key values for the entities.

# **Q) What is custom generator and how can we implement?**<br/>

Let's go through each point you mentioned and provide a detailed explanation for each:

1. **Define one public class**:
   To create a custom generator, you need to define a public class that will implement the `IdentifierGenerator` interface. This class will provide the logic for generating unique identifier values.

2. **Implement IdentifierGenerator (org.hibernate.id)**:
   The `IdentifierGenerator` interface is provided by the `org.hibernate.id` package in Hibernate. By implementing this interface, you can define the custom logic for generating identifiers.

3. **Override method generate()**:
   Within your custom generator class, you need to override the `generate()` method provided by the `IdentifierGenerator` interface. This method will contain your custom logic for generating a unique identifier.

4. **Define your own logic**:
   In the `generate()` method, you can implement your own logic to generate a unique identifier value. This logic can be based on any requirements specific to your application. For example, you may generate the identifier based on a combination of fields, use a custom algorithm, or incorporate external factors like timestamps or sequences.

5. **At Entity class**:
   To use the custom generator, you need to annotate the primary key field in your entity class with `@GeneratedValue` and `@GenericGenerator` annotations.

   - `@GeneratedValue(generator = "<anyName>")`: This annotation specifies the name of the generator to be used for generating the primary key value. The name should match the name provided in the `@GenericGenerator` annotation.
   
   - `@GenericGenerator(name="<anyName>", strategy = "GeneratorClassName")`: This annotation is used to define the custom generator and its corresponding class. It provides the name for the generator and specifies the fully qualified class name of the custom generator implementation.

Here's an example to demonstrate the usage of a custom generator:

```java
public class CustomIdGenerator implements IdentifierGenerator {
    @Override
    public Serializable generate(SharedSessionContractImplementor session, Object entity) throws HibernateException {
        // Custom logic to generate the unique identifier
        // Implement your own generation strategy here
        // Return the generated identifier
    }
}
```

In the above code snippet, we define the `CustomIdGenerator` class, which implements the `IdentifierGenerator` interface. It overrides the `generate()` method, where you can implement your custom logic to generate a unique identifier.

```java
@Entity
public class Book {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(generator = "custom-id-generator")
    @GenericGenerator(name = "custom-id-generator", strategy = "com.example.CustomIdGenerator")
    private Long id;
    // other fields and getters/setters
}
```

In the `Book` entity class, the `id` field is annotated with `@GeneratedValue` and `@GenericGenerator`. The `generator` attribute in `@GeneratedValue` references the name of the custom generator, which should match the name provided in the `@GenericGenerator` annotation. The `name` attribute in `@GenericGenerator` specifies the name of the generator, and the `strategy` attribute specifies the fully qualified class name of the custom generator implementation.

By following these steps, you can define and use a custom generator in your JPA entity to generate unique identifier values according to your specific requirements.

# Here's the code snippet for each class and the corresponding explanation:

**Entity: `Product`**
```java
@Data
@Entity
@Table(name="product_tab")
public class Product {
    
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(generator = "test")
    @GenericGenerator(name="test",strategy = "com.app.shivam.gen.MyCustomGen")
    @Column(name="pid")
    private String prodId;
    
    @Column(name="pname")
    private String prodName;
    
    @Column(name="pcost")
    private Double prodCost;
    
}
```
Explanation:
- The `Product` class represents an entity that is mapped to a database table named "product_tab".
- The `@Id` annotation marks the `prodId` field as the primary key.
- The `@GeneratedValue` annotation specifies that the value of the `prodId` field will be generated by a generator named "test".
- The `@GenericGenerator` annotation defines the custom generator named "test" and specifies its fully qualified class name as "com.app.shivam.gen.MyCustomGen".
- The `@Column` annotations define the mapping between the entity's fields and the corresponding table columns.

**Repository: `ProductRepository`**
```java
public interface ProductRepository extends JpaRepository<Product, Integer> {
}
```
Explanation:
- The `ProductRepository` interface extends `JpaRepository` and provides CRUD operations for the `Product` entity.
- Since the `Product` entity has a primary key of type `String`, the second parameter of `JpaRepository` is `Integer`.

**Runner Class: `TestDataRunner`**
```java
@Component
public final class TestDataRunner implements CommandLineRunner {

    @Autowired
    private ProductRepository repo;
    
    public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
        Product p1 = new Product();
        p1.setProdName("PEN");
        p1.setProdCost(200.0);
        
        p1 = repo.save(p1);
        System.out.println(p1.getProdId());
    }
}
```
Explanation:
- The `TestDataRunner` class is marked with the `@Component` annotation to indicate that it should be treated as a Spring bean.
- It implements the `CommandLineRunner` interface, which allows the execution of code during application startup.
- In the `run()` method, a new `Product` object is created and populated with data.
- The `save()` method of the `ProductRepository` is called to persist the `Product` object in the database.
- The generated `prodId` is printed to the console.

**Custom Generator: `MyCustomGen`**
```java
public class MyCustomGen implements IdentifierGenerator {

    @Override
    public Serializable generate(SharedSessionContractImplementor session, Object object)
            throws HibernateException {

        String pref = "MYPRD-";
        int random = new Random().nextInt();
        random = Math.abs(random);

        String dte = new SimpleDateFormat("ddMMMyy").format(new Date());

        return pref + dte + ":" + random;
    }
}
```
Explanation:
- The `MyCustomGen` class implements the `IdentifierGenerator` interface, which provides the `generate()` method to generate the identifier.
- In the `generate()` method, a custom logic is implemented to generate a unique identifier.
- The identifier consists of a prefix "MYPRD-", the current date in "ddMMMyy" format, and a random number.
- The generated identifier is returned as a `Serializable` object.

**Conclusion:**
In this example, we have a `Product` entity with a custom generator for generating the `prodId` field. The custom gshivam?**<br/>enerator (`MyCustomGen`) implements the `IdentifierGenerator` interface and defines the logic to generate a unique identifier. The `TestDataRunner` class demonstrates the usage of the custom generator by saving a `Product` object with the generated `prodId` using the `ProductRepository`.
