- **Session Interface**: The `Session` interface is provided by Sun/Oracle as part of the JMS API. It is used to establish a connection between the producer and the consumer and create messages to be sent to the consumer.
  - The `Session` interface provides methods for creating different types of messages, sending messages, and managing transactions.
  - It represents a single-threaded context for producing and consuming messages in a JMS provider.

- **Creating Subclass or Anonymous Inner Class**: To use the `Session` interface, you can create a subclass or an anonymous inner class that implements the `Session` interface.
  - By creating a subclass, you can provide custom implementations for the methods defined in the `Session` interface.
  - An alternative approach is to use an anonymous inner class, where you define the implementation of the `Session` interface inline without explicitly creating a separate class.

- **Functional Interface (FI) and Lambda Expressions**: If the interface is a functional interface (FI), meaning it has a single abstract method, you can use lambda expressions to define its implementation.
  - In the case of a functional interface, you can define the implementation using a lambda expression in a concise and readable manner.

- **Producer and Consumer Connecting to the Same Destination**: Both the producer and the consumer applications need to be connected to the same destination.
  - The destination can be a queue or a topic, depending on the desired communication pattern (P2P or Pub/Sub).
  - The destination name should match between the producer and consumer applications to establish the connection correctly.

- **Internal Usage of JMS API**: Both the producer and consumer internally use the JMS API, which provides the necessary interfaces and classes for working with message queues.
  - The JMS API, provided by Sun/Oracle, defines the standard interfaces and protocols for sending, receiving, and processing messages.
  - Apache ActiveMQ, the message queue implementation, provides the concrete implementation classes for the JMS interfaces.

- **TCP Protocol and Port Number**: The producer and consumer communicate with each other using the TCP protocol, which operates on a specific port number.
  - In the case of the ActiveMQ message queue, the default port number is 61616 for TCP communication.
  - This port number is used for establishing the connection and exchanging messages between the producer and consumer applications.

- **Web UI Output and HTTP Protocol**: To view the web user interface (UI) output of the message queue system, you can use the HTTP protocol.
  - The default port number for accessing the web UI is 8161.
  - By accessing the appropriate URL using the HTTP protocol (e.g., http://localhost:8161/admin/), you can view the web-based administration console and monitor the message queue.

- **JmsTemplate in Spring Boot**: Spring Boot provides the `JmsTemplate` class, which is pre-configured and simplifies JMS operations in Spring applications.
  - The `JmsTemplate` class encapsulates the underlying JMS API and provides convenient methods for sending and receiving messages, handling transactions, and executing JMS operations.

- **@EnableJms and @JmsListener**: In the consumer application, you need to apply the `@EnableJms` annotation to enable JMS support and configure the necessary components.
  - The `@JmsListener` annotation is used to specify the destination from which the consumer will receive messages.
  - By applying these annotations, the consumer application can listen for messages from the specified destination and invoke the appropriate method to process the received messages.

In summary, the session interface provided by Sun/Oracle establishes the connection between the producer and the consumer and enables the creation and exchange of messages.
