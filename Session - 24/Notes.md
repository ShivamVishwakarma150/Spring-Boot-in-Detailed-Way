# Here's the code you provided along with detailed explanations for each component:

1. Spring Bean (MyDbConnection):
```java
package com.app.shivam.dbcon;

import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import lombok.Data;

@Component
@Data
@ConfigurationProperties("my.db")
public class MyDbConnection {

	private String driver;
	private String url;
	private String user;
	private String pwd;
	
}
```
Explanation:
- This class represents a Spring Bean component named `MyDbConnection`.
- The `@Component` annotation marks it as a Spring component to be managed by the Spring container.
- The `@Data` annotation, provided by Lombok, generates boilerplate code for getter and setter methods, toString(), equals(), and hashCode() methods.
- The `@ConfigurationProperties("my.db")` annotation binds the properties prefixed with `my.db` from the YAML file to the corresponding fields of this bean.

2. YAML File:
```yaml
my:
  db:
    driver: Oracle
    pwd: shivam
    url: jdbc-oracle
    user: vikash
---
spring:
  config:
    activate:
      on-profile:
      - prod
      - prodps

my:
  db:
    driver: MySQL
    pwd: shivam
    url: jdbc-mysql
    user: vikash
---
spring:
  config:
    activate:
      on-profile:
      - qa
      - uat

my:
  db:
    driver: Postgress
    pwd: shivam
    url: jdbc-psg
    user: vikash
```
Explanation:
- This YAML file defines the configuration properties for different profiles (`prod`, `prodps`, `qa`, `uat`).
- Each profile's properties are separated by `---`, creating distinct sections for each profile.
- For the `prod` and `prodps` profiles, the `my.db` properties are set for an Oracle database.
- For the `qa` and `uat` profiles, the `my.db` properties are set for a MySQL database.
- For the default profile, the `my.db` properties are set for a Postgres database.

3. Runner class (TestDataRunner):
```java
package com.app.shivam.runner;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import com.app.shivam.dbcon.MyDbConnection;

@Component
public class TestDataRunner implements CommandLineRunner {

	@Autowired
	private MyDbConnection con;
	
	public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
		System.out.println(con);
	}

}
```
Explanation:
- This class is a Spring component annotated with `@Component` to be managed by the Spring container.
- It implements the `CommandLineRunner` interface, allowing the `run()` method to be executed during application startup.
- The `MyDbConnection` bean is autowired to this class, enabling access to the configured database connection properties.
- In the `run()` method, the `MyDbConnection` instance is printed, demonstrating the usage of the configured properties.

In conclusion, the provided code demonstrates the usage of profiles in Spring Boot with YAML configuration. The `MyDbConnection` bean is configured with different properties based on the active profile defined in the YAML file. The `TestDataRunner` class showcases accessing the configured properties in a Spring component.

# Here's a detailed explanation of each point mentioned regarding the `@Profile` annotation:

1. `@Profile` annotation:
- The `@Profile` annotation is used to mark a component or a method with a specific profile name.
- It allows you to define conditional logic and execute certain code only in specific environments.
- The annotation accepts a profile name as a parameter, specifying in which environment the annotated component or method should be active.

2. Case#1: No `@Profile` annotation:
- If a component or method doesn't have the `@Profile` annotation, it will be executed in all environments.
- The logic inside that component or method will run regardless of the active profile.

3. Case#2: `@Profile("default")` annotation:
- When a component or method is annotated with `@Profile("default")`, it will only be executed in the development environment.
- The "default" profile is active when no specific profile is provided while running the application.

4. Case#3: `@Profile("profileName")` annotation:
- By specifying a specific profile name (e.g., `@Profile("prod")`), the annotated component or method will only be executed in the corresponding profile's environment.
- This allows you to conditionally execute code based on different profiles such as production, testing, or staging.

5. Profile selection during application startup:
- If no profile name is provided while running the application, the Spring container will automatically select the "default" profile.
- This means that components or methods annotated with `@Profile("default")` will be executed in this case.

6. Independent of properties/yaml:
- The `@Profile` annotation is independent of properties or YAML files.
- It doesn't directly control the loading of configuration files.
- If a specific profile's properties or YAML file is not present in the code or workspace, the container will fall back to the default configuration file (e.g., `application.properties` or `application.yml`).

In conclusion, the `@Profile` annotation allows you to conditionally execute logic based on the active profile. By annotating components or methods with specific profile names, you can control when they should be executed. The "default" profile is used when no specific profile is provided, and the annotation is independent of configuration files.

# Here's the explanation of the example code you provided:

1. DbUserSetupRunner:
- This class implements the `CommandLineRunner` interface, indicating that it contains code to be executed during application startup.
- The class is annotated with `@Component`, making it a Spring bean that is automatically detected and registered in the application context.
- The class is also annotated with `@Profile({"qa","default","uat"})`, specifying that it should be executed when any of the profiles "qa", "default", or "uat" are active.
- Inside the `run` method, it prints a message indicating that it is being executed: "FROM DbUser SETUP RUNNER".

2. BackDataServiceRunner:
- Similar to `DbUserSetupRunner`, this class also implements the `CommandLineRunner` interface and is annotated with `@Component`.
- It is annotated with `@Profile({"prod","podsup","uat"})`, indicating that it should be executed when any of the profiles "prod", "podsup", or "uat" are active.
- Inside the `run` method, it prints a message indicating that it is being executed: "FROM BACKUP DATA SERVICE".

3. MessageRunner:
- This class is also annotated with `@Component`, making it a Spring bean.
- It doesn't have any `@Profile` annotation, which means it will be executed in all profiles.
- Inside the `run` method, it prints a default message: "DEFAULT MESSAGE RUNNER".

In this example, we have three runner classes implementing the `CommandLineRunner` interface. Each runner class has a different `@Profile` annotation, specifying in which profiles it should be executed. The messages printed in the `run` methods indicate which runner class is being executed.

If no specific profile is provided while running the application, the `DbUserSetupRunner` and `BackDataServiceRunner` will be executed due to the `@Profile({"qa","default","uat"})` and `@Profile({"prod","podsup","uat"})` annotations, respectively. The `MessageRunner` will also be executed as it doesn't have any `@Profile` annotation.

In conclusion, the `@Profile` annotation allows you to selectively execute code based on the active profiles. By annotating components or methods with specific profiles, you can control which parts of the application logic should be executed in different environments.

# Here's some more detailed explanation about `@profile`:

To inform the Spring container to create selected class objects only in the Prod environment, you can use the `@Profile` annotation.

Example 1:
```java
@Component
@Profile("prod")
class Sample {

}
```
In this example, the `Sample` class is annotated with `@Component`, indicating that it is a Spring bean. Additionally, it is annotated with `@Profile("prod")`, specifying that this bean should only be created when the "prod" profile is active. In other profiles, this bean will not be created by the container.

Example 2:
```java
@Configuration
class AppConfig {
  @Bean
  @Profile("prod")
  public DbCon dbc() {
    // Bean configuration
  }
}
```
In this example, the `AppConfig` class is annotated with `@Configuration`, indicating that it provides bean configurations. The `dbc()` method is annotated with `@Bean` to indicate that it produces a bean. The `@Profile("prod")` annotation on the method specifies that this bean should only be created when the "prod" profile is active.

When the application runs, the Spring container checks the active profiles. If the active profile matches the one specified in the `@Profile` annotation, the corresponding bean or bean method is created and registered in the container. Otherwise, it is skipped.

By using the `@Profile` annotation, you can control the creation of specific beans or bean methods based on the active profiles. This allows you to customize the behavior of your application for different environments.

# Here's a detailed explanation of code `@Profile` for Object creation:

1. Spring Bean: ExportExcelService
```java
@Component
@Profile({"default","qa"})
public class ExportExcelService {
	
	@Value("csv")
	private String extCode;
	
	@Value("#{new java.util.Random().nextInt()}")
	private Integer formatId;
	
}
```
The `ExportExcelService` class is annotated with `@Component`, indicating that it is a Spring bean. It is also annotated with `@Profile({"default","qa"})`, specifying that this bean should only be created when the "default" or "qa" profiles are active. The `@Value` annotation is used to inject values into the `extCode` and `formatId` fields.

2. Java Config Code: AppConfig
```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
	
	@Bean
	@Profile({"default","qa"})
	public PdfExportService pdf() {
		PdfExportService p = new PdfExportService();
		p.setFileExt(".pdf");
		p.setFtype("Document-NPDF");
		return p;
	}
}
```
The `AppConfig` class is annotated with `@Configuration`, indicating that it provides bean configurations. The `pdf()` method is annotated with `@Bean` and `@Profile({"default","qa"})`, specifying that this bean should only be created when the "default" or "qa" profiles are active. Inside the method, a `PdfExportService` object is created, configured with the desired values, and returned as a bean.

3. Runner class: TestObjRunner
```java
@Component
public class TestObjRunner implements CommandLineRunner {
	
	@Autowired
	private ExportExcelService es;
	
	@Autowired
	private PdfExportService pdfs;
	
	public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
		System.out.println(es);
		System.out.println(pdfs);
	}

}
```
The `TestObjRunner` class is annotated with `@Component`, indicating that it is a Spring bean. Inside the `run()` method, the `ExportExcelService` and `PdfExportService` beans are autowired for usage. When the application runs, these beans will be created and injected into the `es` and `pdfs` variables, respectively. The objects will be printed to the console for verification.

By using the `@Profile` annotation, you can control which beans are created and injected based on the active profiles. This allows you to customize the object creation and configuration based on different environments.

# Here are some frequently asked questions related to `@Profile` in Spring Boot, along with their answers:

**Q1: What is the purpose of `@Profile` annotation in Spring Boot?**<br/>
A1: The `@Profile` annotation is used to conditionally enable or disable beans based on the active profiles. It allows you to control which beans are created and used based on the targeted environment or specific configurations.

**Q2: How can we specify multiple profiles for a bean using `@Profile`?**<br/>
A2: You can specify multiple profiles for a bean using the `@Profile` annotation by passing an array of profile names as the value. For example: `@Profile({"dev", "local"})`.

**Q3: What happens if no profile is specified with `@Profile` for a bean?**<br/>
A3: If no profile is specified with `@Profile` for a bean, the bean will be created and available in all profiles.

**Q4: Can we use `@Profile` with `@Configuration` classes?**<br/>
A4: Yes, you can use `@Profile` with `@Configuration` classes. It allows you to conditionally configure beans based on the active profiles.

**Q5: How can we activate a specific profile in Spring Boot?**<br/>
A5: You can activate a specific profile in Spring Boot by setting the `spring.profiles.active` property. You can provide the active profile either as a command-line argument (`--spring.profiles.active=dev`) or by setting it in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file (`spring.profiles.active=dev`).

**Q6: Can we use `@Profile` annotation with constructor injection?**<br/>
A6: Yes, you can use `@Profile` annotation with constructor injection. The bean with the matching profile will be injected into the constructor when the profile is active.

**Q9: Can we override profiles defined in properties or YAML files using command-line arguments?**<br/>
A9: Yes, you can override profiles defined in properties or YAML files using command-line arguments. The profile specified in the command-line argument will take precedence over the profiles defined in the configuration files.

**Q10: How can we set default profiles in Spring Boot?**<br/>
A10: You can set default profiles in Spring Boot by using the `spring.profiles.default` property. This property defines the profiles to be used when no other active profiles are specified.

**Q11: Can we use `@Profile` annotation with Spring Data repositories?**<br/>
A11: Yes, you can use `@Profile` annotation with Spring Data repositories. The repositories with matching profiles will be created and used when the profile is active.

**Q12: Is it possible to enable or disable specific endpoints based on profiles?**<br/>
A12: Yes, you can enable or disable specific endpoints based on profiles using the `@Profile` annotation in conjunction with the `@ConditionalOnBean` or `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` annotations.

**Q13: Can we specify profile-specific database configurations in Spring Boot?**<br/>
A13: Yes, you can specify profile-specific database configurations in Spring Boot by defining different sets of properties or YAML files for each profile. The configuration will be loaded based on the active profile.

**Q14: Is it possible to have conditional properties based on profiles in Spring Boot?**<br/>
A14: Yes, you can have conditional properties based on profiles in Spring Boot. You can define different sets of properties for each profile in the `application-{profile}.properties` or `application-{profile}.yml` files.

**Q15: How can we unit test profile-specific beans in Spring Boot?**<br/>
A15: You can unit test profile-specific beans in Spring Boot by using the `@ActiveProfiles` annotation in your test class. It allows you to specify the profiles to be activated during the test execution.

These are some common questions related to `@Profile` in Spring Boot. Understanding and utilizing the `@Profile` annotation can help you create flexible and configurable applications based on different environments and configurations.
