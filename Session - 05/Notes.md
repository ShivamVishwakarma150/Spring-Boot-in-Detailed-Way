# Detailed Notes 


======================Spring Bean==========================

1. The class should be declared as `public`. This allows the Spring container to access and manage the class as a bean.

2. The class should be in a package. It is recommended to place the class in the base package or a sub-package of the base package. This helps in component scanning by the Spring container.

3. Instance variables (fields) are recommended to be declared as `private`. This follows the principle of encapsulation.

4. Provide a default constructor with mutators (setter/getter methods) or a parameterized constructor. Having a default constructor allows the Spring container to create an instance of the bean using reflection. Mutators provide a way to set the values of the bean's properties.

5. The bean class can override methods from the `Object` class such as `toString()`, `equals()`, and `hashCode()`. However, overriding these methods should follow their general contracts and guidelines.

6. The bean class can inherit from other valid Spring beans using `extends` or `implements`. It is important to note that the inheritance should be limited to valid Spring beans and not external APIs like Servlets or EJBs.

7. Spring beans can implement the `java.io.Serializable` interface. This allows the beans to be serialized, meaning they can be converted into a different format such as network format, file format, or global formats like XML or JSON.

Annotations can be used to configure and define Spring beans. The annotations can be categorized into the following:

- Core Annotations: These are annotations provided by the `java.lang` package or the core Spring framework.

- Spring Framework Annotations: These are annotations specific to the Spring framework that provide additional functionality and configurations for beans.

- Integration Annotations: These are annotations related to integrations with other frameworks or technologies, such as JPA (Java Persistence API).

Additional Notes:

- Use the keyboard shortcut `ctrl+shift+T` to quickly navigate to objects within your IDE.
- Use the keyboard shortcut `ctrl+O` to view the members and methods of the current class in your IDE.
- The term "native" refers to a method that has its implementation code written in another language, typically the C language.
- When overriding the `equals()` method, it is recommended to also override the `hashCode()` method to maintain the contract between these two methods.
- Serialization refers to the process of converting an object into a different format, such as a network format, file format, or standardized formats like XML or JSON.

Q) Is class B serialized?

    
    class A implements Serializable {
    }

    class B extends A{
    }
    
A) Yes, class B is serialized because it extends class A, which implements the `Serializable` interface.

Q) I want class B to avoid serialization?
  <br/>A)To make class B avoid serialization, you can mark it as `transient`. By using the `transient` keyword, the field or class member will not be serialized.

# Spring Bean 

In Spring Framework, a Spring Bean is an object that is managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. It is the fundamental building block of a Spring application. Spring Beans are Java objects that are instantiated, assembled, and managed by the Spring container.

Detailed Explanation of Spring Beans:

1. Definition: A Spring Bean is a Java object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by the Spring IoC container. It represents a component or service within the application.

2. Object Lifecycle Management: The Spring container is responsible for the lifecycle management of Spring Beans. It creates instances of beans, handles dependencies, and manages the destruction of beans when they are no longer needed.

3. Dependency Injection (DI): One of the key features of Spring is Dependency Injection. It allows the Spring container to inject dependencies into a bean, rather than the bean itself managing its dependencies. This promotes loose coupling and improves testability and maintainability.

4. Configuration: Spring Beans are typically configured through XML files, Java-based configuration, or annotations. These configurations define how the beans should be created, wired together, and managed by the container.

5. Scopes: Spring Beans can have different scopes that define the lifecycle and visibility of the bean. The most commonly used scopes are Singleton (one instance per container) and Prototype (a new instance per request).

6. Bean Wiring: Spring Beans can be wired together using various mechanisms such as setter injection, constructor injection, and autowiring. Wiring is the process of connecting beans and their dependencies.

7. Bean Post-Processing: Spring provides BeanPostProcessor interfaces that allow you to customize the initialization and destruction process of beans. These interfaces enable you to perform additional actions before or after bean initialization.

8. AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming): Spring Beans can be enhanced with AOP capabilities. AOP allows you to separate cross-cutting concerns (such as logging, security, and transaction management) from the core business logic of the application.

9. Integration: Spring Beans can be seamlessly integrated with other technologies and frameworks such as JDBC, JPA, Hibernate, and more. This integration simplifies the development process and promotes interoperability.

10. Testing: Spring Beans are easy to test because of their dependency injection nature. Dependencies can be easily mocked or stubbed, making it straightforward to write unit tests for individual beans.

11. Runtime Management: The Spring container provides runtime management of beans, allowing you to monitor and control the lifecycle of beans during the application's execution.

In summary, a Spring Bean is a managed object within the Spring IoC container. It is instantiated, wired, and managed by the container, following the principles of Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection. Spring Beans provide a modular and flexible approach to building applications, promoting loose coupling and enhancing testability and maintainability.

# Rules for a class for become a Spring Bean

To become a Spring Bean, a class needs to follow certain rules and guidelines. These rules ensure that the class can be properly instantiated, managed, and injected by the Spring IoC container. Here are the key rules for a class to become a Spring Bean:

1. Public Class: The class must be declared as public so that the Spring container can access and manage it.

2. Class in a Package: The class should be located in a package. It can be in the base package or a sub-package. The Spring container scans the specified package(s) to discover and manage beans.

3. Default Constructor: The class should provide a default constructor (a constructor with no arguments). This allows the Spring container to create an instance of the bean using the default constructor during the instantiation process. Alternatively, a parameterized constructor can be used, but a default constructor is recommended.

4. Accessor Methods: The class should have appropriate accessor methods (setter/getter methods) for its properties or dependencies. These methods allow the Spring container to inject values or dependencies into the bean. The naming convention for the accessor methods should follow the JavaBean standard.

5. Object Class Methods: The class can override methods from the Object class, such as toString(), equals(), and hashCode(). However, it is important to ensure that the contracts of these methods are properly maintained to avoid any unexpected behavior.

6. Inheritance with Valid Spring Beans: The class can inherit from other valid Spring Beans. This means that a Spring Bean can extend another Spring Bean or implement an interface that represents a Spring Bean. However, the class should not inherit from Servlets, EJBs, or other external APIs.

7. Implementing Serializable: If needed, the class can implement the java.io.Serializable interface. This allows the bean to be serialized and deserialized, which is useful for scenarios like storing the bean's state in a distributed cache or transferring it over a network.

8. Annotations: The class can be annotated with various annotations provided by the Spring Framework. These annotations include Core Annotations from the java.lang package, Spring Framework Annotations, and Integration Annotations for integrating with other technologies (e.g., JPA annotations).

By following these rules, a class can be effectively registered and managed as a Spring Bean by the Spring IoC container. The Spring container will then take care of the lifecycle, dependency injection, and other aspects of managing the bean within the application context.

# Contract between equals method and hashCode method in java

In Java, there is a contract between the `equals()` method and the `hashCode()` method. This contract is defined in the `Object` class and must be followed when overriding these methods in your own classes. The contract ensures consistency and correctness when using objects in collections such as `HashMap`, `HashSet`, and `Hashtable`. Here are the key points of the contract:

1. Consistency: The `equals()` method must be consistent with the `hashCode()` method. This means that if two objects are equal according to the `equals()` method, their hash codes should be equal as well. Conversely, if two objects have different hash codes, they should be considered unequal according to the `equals()` method.

2. Same objects, same hash codes: If two objects are equal according to the `equals()` method, they must have the same hash code. This means that the `hashCode()` method should return the same value for two equal objects.

3. Unequal objects, different hash codes: While it is not required for two unequal objects to have different hash codes, it is generally desired for performance reasons. Different hash codes help distribute objects evenly across buckets in hash-based data structures, reducing collisions and improving performance.

4. Overriding both methods: If you choose to override the `equals()` method in your class, you must also override the `hashCode()` method. This ensures that the contract is upheld and that objects can be used correctly in hash-based collections.

5. Dependency on mutable fields: If the state of an object can change, and the object is used as a key in a hash-based collection, then the fields used in the `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods should be based on immutable fields only. Changing a mutable field used in these methods can lead to inconsistencies and incorrect behavior in hash-based collections.

By following this contract, you can ensure that your classes behave correctly when used in collections that rely on hashing, such as `HashMap`. It is important to properly implement both methods and maintain the consistency and correctness defined by the contract.

# Class Code Explanation (Spring First Application)

Here's a  detailed code explanation of the example:

1. Spring Bean (OracleCon.java):
```java
package my.app;

public class OracleCon {
   private String driver;
   private String url;

   // Default constructor
   public OracleCon() {}

   // Setter and getter methods for driver
   public void setDriver(String driver) {
      this.driver = driver;
   }
   public String getDriver() {
      return driver;
   }

   // Setter and getter methods for url
   public void setUrl(String url) {
      this.url = url;
   }
   public String getUrl() {
      return url;
   }

   // Overriding toString() method
   @Override
   public String toString() {
      return "OracleCon [driver=" + driver + ", url=" + url + "]";
   }
}
```

2. Spring XML Configuration (config.xml):
```xml
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean id="con" class="my.app.OracleCon">
        <property name="driver" value="oracle" />
        <property name="url" value="sample" />
    </bean>

</beans>
```

3. Test Class:
```java
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;

public class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Create the Spring container (ApplicationContext)
      ApplicationContext applicationContext = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("config.xml");

      // Retrieve the OracleCon bean from the container
      OracleCon con = (OracleCon) applicationContext.getBean("con");

      // Print the OracleCon object to view the data
      System.out.println(con);
   }
}
```

Explanation:
- In the `OracleCon` class, we define two private fields: `driver` and `url`. We provide setter and getter methods for these fields. We also override the `toString()` method to provide a meaningful representation of the object.
- In the `config.xml` file, we define a bean with the id "con" and the class "my.app.OracleCon". Inside the bean, we use `<property>` tags to set the values of the `driver` and `url` properties.
- In the `Main` class, we create an instance of `ApplicationContext` using `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`, passing the location of the XML configuration file as the argument.
- We retrieve the `OracleCon` bean from the container using `getBean("con")`, and we cast it to `OracleCon` type.
- Finally, we print the `con` object, which calls the `toString()` method and displays the values of the `driver` and `url` properties.

When you run the `Main` class, it will load the XML configuration file, create the `OracleCon` bean with the specified properties, and print the object to the console.

This example demonstrates the complete flow of creating a Spring bean, configuring it using XML, and accessing the bean from the Spring container.

In the given example, we have a simple Spring application that demonstrates the creation of a Spring container, object creation, and accessing the created object. Let's break down the example into three parts:

1. Spring Bean:
We define a Spring bean class `OracleCon` in the `my.app` package. This class has private fields `driver` and `url` with their respective setter and getter methods. It also overrides the `toString()` method.

2. Spring XML Configuration:
We create an XML configuration file, `config.xml`, where we define the bean `con` of type `my.app.OracleCon`. Inside the `con` bean, we set the values for the `driver` and `url` properties using the `<property>` tags.

3. Test Class:
In the test class, we create an instance of the `ApplicationContext` interface using the `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` implementation, providing the location of the XML configuration file (`config.xml`) as the argument.

We retrieve the `OracleCon` bean from the container using the `getBean()` method, passing the bean id (`con`) as the argument. We cast the returned object to `OracleCon` type and assign it to the `con` variable.

Finally, we print the `con` object, which internally calls the `toString()` method of the `OracleCon` class, allowing us to view the data of the object.

The `<bean>` tag in the XML configuration file represents the creation of an object (Spring bean) in the Spring container. It specifies the class of the bean using the `class` attribute. Inside the `<bean>` tag, we can use `<property>` tags to set the values of the bean's properties.

In summary, this example demonstrates the basic setup of a Spring application, including the creation of a Spring container, definition of a Spring bean in XML configuration, and retrieving and accessing the bean from the container.
