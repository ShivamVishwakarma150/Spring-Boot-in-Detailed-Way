# Here's the code for each class along with an explanation of their purpose:

1. Entity (Student.java):
```java
package com.app.shivam.entity;

import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id;
import org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.mapping.Document;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Document
public class Student {

	@Id
	private String id;
	private String name;
	private Double fee;
}
```
Explanation: This class represents the entity or model for a Student. It defines the attributes of a student such as id, name, and fee. The `@Document` annotation specifies that this class is mapped to a MongoDB document.

2. Repository (StudentRepository.java):
```java
package com.app.shivam.repo;

import org.springframework.data.mongodb.repository.ReactiveMongoRepository;

import com.app.shivam.entity.Student;

public interface StudentRepository extends ReactiveMongoRepository<Student, String>{

}
```
Explanation: This interface extends `ReactiveMongoRepository` provided by Spring Data MongoDB. It allows performing CRUD operations on the `Student` entity. It provides standard database operations like save, findById, delete, etc.

3. Service (StudentService.java):
```java
package com.app.shivam.service;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import com.app.shivam.entity.Student;
import com.app.shivam.repo.StudentRepository;

import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

@Service
public class StudentService {

	@Autowired
	private StudentRepository repo;

	public Mono<Student> save(Student student) {
		return repo.save(student);
	}

	public Mono<Student> getOne(String id) {
		return repo.findById(id).switchIfEmpty(Mono.empty());
	}

	public Flux<Student> findAll() {
		return repo.findAll().switchIfEmpty(Flux.empty());
	}

	public Mono<Void> delete(String id) {
		return repo.deleteById(id);
	}
}
```
Explanation: This service class handles the business logic for managing student data. It interacts with the `StudentRepository` to perform CRUD operations on the MongoDB database. It provides methods for saving a student, retrieving a student by id, retrieving all students, and deleting a student.

4. RestController (StudentRestController.java):
```java
package com.app.shivam.rest;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestBody;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

import com.app.shivam.entity.Student;
import com.app.shivam.service.StudentService;

import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/student")
public class StudentRestController {

	@Autowired
	private StudentService service;

	@PostMapping("/create")
	public Mono<Student> save(@RequestBody Student student) {
		return service.save(student);
	}
}
```
Explanation: This REST controller class exposes an API endpoint for creating a student. It handles HTTP POST requests to the `/student/create` URL and expects a JSON representation of a student in the request body. It delegates the saving of the student to the `StudentService` and returns a `Mono<Student>` as a reactive response.

5. Properties file (application.properties):
```
server.port=9090

spring.data.mongodb.host=localhost
spring.data.mongodb.database=bootdb
spring.data.mongodb.port=27017
```
Explanation: This file contains configuration properties for the Spring Boot application. It specifies the server port and the MongoDB connection details, including the host, database name, and port.

Conclusion:
The provided code represents a Spring Boot application using Spring WebFlux and Reactive MongoDB API. It demonstrates the implementation of a RESTful API for managing student data, including saving a student record to MongoDB. The application utilizes reactive programming concepts, allowing for non-blocking and efficient handling of requests.

# Here's the explanation for each point you mentioned:

**1. PK Type and Generation:**
- By default, the PK (Primary Key) type is set to String in the provided code. However, it can be changed to any other data type according to the requirements.
- The PK value is generated as a hexadecimal value using UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) internally. This ensures that each generated ID is unique across different instances and time.
- Example: `"id": "63d48120435d697460977319"`

**2. PK Field Name:**
- In MongoDB, the PK field name is taken as `_id` by default. The `@Id` annotation in the `Student` entity maps the `id` field to the `_id` field in the database.

**3. _class Property:**
- If the `_class` property is present in the stored document, it indicates that the data originated from external sources such as Java or .NET. The presence of this property helps in mapping the document to the corresponding class during deserialization.

**4. Usage of Data Types for PK:**
- If a different data type is used for the PK field in the code (other than String), the PK value will not be automatically generated. In such cases, a manual value needs to be assigned to the PK field when creating a new document.

Regarding the Consumer part with Spring Webflux and WebClient, it seems that the code for the consumer part is not provided in the given information. However, based on the mentioned technologies, the consumer would typically use WebClient, which is a non-blocking, reactive HTTP client provided by Spring Webflux. It allows making HTTP requests to external services or APIs.

In conclusion, the provided code focuses on the producer side, demonstrating the implementation of a Spring Boot application using Spring Webflux and Reactive MongoDB API. It covers the model/entity, repository, service, and REST controller for managing student data. The code utilizes reactive programming concepts to enable efficient and non-blocking handling of requests.
