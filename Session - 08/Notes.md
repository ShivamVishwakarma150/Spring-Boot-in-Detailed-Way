# Let's summarize the key points:

1. `@ComponentScan` is used to specify the base package(s) where the Spring container should scan for classes.
   - The `basePackages` attribute of `@ComponentScan` allows you to provide one or more package names as an array.
   - The container searches for classes within the specified base packages and their sub-packages.

2. `@Component` is a stereotype annotation used to indicate that a class is a Spring-managed component.
   - When a class is annotated with `@Component`, the Spring container creates an instance of that class and manages its lifecycle.
   - `@Component` is a generic annotation that can be used for any type of Spring bean.

Here's a summary of the process:

1. The `@ComponentScan` annotation is added to a configuration class (e.g., `MyAppConfig`).
   - It specifies the base package(s) where the container should search for components.
   - The base package can be the same package or its sub-packages.
   - For example, `@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.app")` tells the container to scan the `com.app` package and its sub-packages.

2. Classes that should be managed by the Spring container are annotated with `@Component`.
   - When the container scans the specified base package, it identifies classes with the `@Component` annotation.
   - The container creates an instance of each annotated class and manages its lifecycle.
   - These instances become Spring beans that can be accessed and used throughout the application.

For example:
```java
@Component("eobj")
public class EmailConfig {
    // Class implementation
}
```

In this example, the `EmailConfig` class is annotated with `@Component` and provides the bean name `"eobj"`.
- The `@ComponentScan` configuration in `MyAppConfig` tells the container to scan the appropriate package.
- When the container encounters the `EmailConfig` class, it creates an instance of `EmailConfig` and registers it as a bean with the name `"eobj"`.
- Later, you can retrieve the `EmailConfig` bean from the container using the bean name.

Remember to ensure that your classes are present within the specified base package or its sub-packages and are correctly annotated with `@Component` (or other stereotype annotations if applicable) for the container to create and manage the objects correctly.

# Q) Why are we using .properties / .xml / .yml files here?

A) We use .properties, .xml, or .yml files in our applications to store configuration data or externalize certain values that are required for the application to run. These files serve as a means to provide input data to the application at runtime. Here are the main reasons for using these files:

1. **Separation of Configuration**: Storing configuration data in separate files allows us to decouple the configuration from the code. This separation makes it easier to manage and modify the configuration without modifying the source code. It promotes maintainability and flexibility in the application.

2. **Externalization of Values**: Many applications require values that can change depending on the environment or specific deployment. By using external configuration files, we can provide different values for different environments (e.g., development, testing, production) without modifying the code. It enables us to customize the application behavior based on specific runtime conditions.

3. **Ease of Modification**: Configuration files are typically in a human-readable format, making it easier to modify the values when needed. Instead of recompiling the code, we can simply update the values in the configuration file. This simplifies the process of making configuration changes and avoids the need for redeployment.

4. **Security and Confidentiality**: Certain sensitive information, such as database credentials or API keys, should not be hardcoded in the source code for security reasons. By storing such sensitive data in external configuration files, we can prevent unauthorized access to these values. The configuration files can be secured separately, and access can be restricted based on security measures.

5. **Compatibility with Different Formats**: Different applications or frameworks may have different preferences for configuration file formats. Using .properties, .xml, or .yml files allows us to choose the format that best suits the application or integrate with other tools that support those formats. It provides flexibility and compatibility across different systems and environments.

Overall, using .properties, .xml, or .yml files for configuration allows us to manage, modify, and provide runtime data to the application in a flexible and externalized manner. It enhances maintainability, scalability, and security of the application configuration.

# Here's an enhanced version of the information regarding .properties files and injecting values using the `@Value` annotation:

- .properties files: 
  - A .properties file is a configuration file commonly used to store key-value pairs.
  - The format of a .properties file is `key=value`.
  - Keys are case-sensitive. For example, `key1` and `Key1` are considered different keys.
  - If the same key is defined multiple times in a .properties file, the last occurrence of the key-value pair will be considered.
  - Comments in a .properties file are denoted by the `#` symbol.
  - Special characters such as underscore `_`, dot `.`, and dash `-` can be used in key names.
  - The values in a .properties file are by default treated as strings.

- Autoparsing based on variable datatype:
  - When using the `@Value` annotation to inject values from a .properties file, Spring performs automatic parsing based on the variable's datatype.
  - By default, both the key and the value in the .properties file are considered as strings.
  - If the variable's datatype is different from String, Spring attempts to convert the string value to the specified datatype.
  - For example, if the property in the .properties file is `app.sid=200`, where `app.sid` is the key and `200` is the value, and the variable in the bean class is of type `int`, Spring will automatically convert the string value "200" to an integer.

- Loading properties file into the Spring container:
  - To load a properties file into the Spring container, the `@PropertySource` annotation is used.
  - The `@PropertySource` annotation is applied to a configuration class and specifies the location of the properties file.
  - For example, `@PropertySource("classpath:myapp.properties")` indicates that the `myapp.properties` file is located in the classpath.
  - The properties file can be placed in the resources folder of the project or any other location accessible by the classpath.

- Injecting values using `@Value`:
  - To inject values from the properties file into variables (dependencies), the `@Value` annotation is used.
  - The `@Value` annotation is applied to the variable, and the corresponding key is provided in the form of `${key}`.
  - Spring retrieves the value associated with the key from the properties file and injects it into the variable.
  - For example, `@Value("${app.sid}")` injects the value associated with the key `app.sid` into the annotated variable.

- Spring environment and property resolution:
  - When the properties file is loaded, Spring creates an instance of the `Environment` interface from the `org.springframework.core.env` package.
  - The environment object holds all the key-value pairs from the loaded properties file and provides methods to access and resolve properties.
  - By default, the `Environment` object used by the Spring container is an instance of `StandardEnvironment`.
  - The `@Value` annotation, along with the `${key}` syntax, leverages the environment object to resolve the property values.

Overall, .properties files provide a convenient way to store configuration data in key-value format. By using the `@PropertySource` annotation and the `@Value` annotation in Spring, we can load the properties file into the container and inject the values into our beans, allowing for flexible and customizable configuration of the application.

# Let's go through the provided example step by step with detailed code explanations:

1. Properties file (myapp.properties):
```properties
# This is a sample properties file
# my.db.driver=OracleDriver
my.db.driver=MySQLDriver
my.db-url=jdbc:oracle:thin:sample
my.db_user=abcd
my.db-pwd=shivam
# keys are case-sensitive
my.db-Pwd=sample
my.grade.id=240S
```
- The properties file contains key-value pairs in the format `key=value`.
- It includes various properties such as database driver, URL, username, and password.
- Comments in the properties file are denoted by the `#` symbol.

1. Spring Config Input (MyAppConfig.java):
```java
package com.app;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.PropertySource;

@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.app")
@PropertySource("classpath:myapp.properties")
public class MyAppConfig {
}
```
- The `@ComponentScan` annotation is used to specify the base package to scan for Spring components.
- The `@PropertySource` annotation is used to load the properties file (`myapp.properties`) into the Spring container.
- In this example, the properties file is expected to be located on the classpath.

3. Spring Bean + Annotation Configuration (DatabaseConnection.java):
```java
package com.app.bean;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component("con")
public class DatabaseConnection {
	
	@Value("${my.grade.id}")
	private int code;
	
	@Value("${my.db.driver}")
	private String driver;
	
	@Value("${my.db-url}")
	private String url;
	
	@Value("${my.db_user}")
	private String userName;
	
	@Value("${my.db-pwd}")
	private String userPwd;
	
	@Override
	public String toString() {
		return "DatabaseConnection [code=" + code + ", driver=" + driver + ", url=" + url + ", userName=" + userName
				+ ", userPwd=" + userPwd + "]";
	}
}
```
- The `@Component` annotation marks the `DatabaseConnection` class as a Spring component.
- The class has several instance variables annotated with `@Value`, which injects values from the properties file.
- Each `@Value` annotation specifies the key to retrieve the corresponding value from the properties file.

4. Test class (Test.java):
```java
package com.app.test;

import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext;

import com.app.MyAppConfig;

public class Test {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ApplicationContext ac = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(MyAppConfig.class);
		Object ob = ac.getBean("con");
		System.out.println(ob);
	}
}
```
- The `Test` class serves as the entry point for the application.
- It creates an instance of the `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` by providing the configuration class (`MyAppConfig.class`).
- The `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` scans for Spring components based on the `@ComponentScan` configuration in `MyAppConfig`.
- The `ac.getBean("con")` retrieves the bean named "con" (which is the `DatabaseConnection` bean) from the application context.
- Finally, the `toString()` method is called on the retrieved bean and printed to the console.

Overall, this example demonstrates how to use a properties file to configure Spring beans. The properties file is loaded into the Spring container using the `@PropertySource` annotation, and values are injected into the beans using the `@Value` annotation.

# Let's dive into the details of inheritance (IS-A) and association (HAS-A) in Java.

1. Inheritance (IS-A):
   Inheritance is a mechanism in Java that allows classes and interfaces to inherit properties and behaviors from other classes or interfaces. It establishes a relationship between the superclass (parent) and the subclass (child).

   - Syntax:
     ```java
     class Subclass extends Superclass {
         // subclass members
     }
     ```

   - Inheritance Types:
     - Class Inheritance: A class can extend only one superclass at a time using the `extends` keyword.
     - Interface Inheritance: An interface can extend one or more interfaces using the `extends` keyword.

   - Inheritance Example:
     ```java
     class Animal {
         // common attributes and methods of animals
     }

     class Dog extends Animal {
         // additional attributes and methods specific to dogs
     }
     ```

   - Inheritance establishes an "IS-A" relationship, meaning a subclass "IS-A" type of its superclass. For example, a `Dog` "IS-A" type of `Animal`.

2. Association (HAS-A):
   Association represents a relationship between two or more classes where one class has a reference to another class. It is typically referred to as a "HAS-A" relationship.

   - Syntax:
     ```java
     class ClassA {
         // class members
     }

     class ClassB {
         ClassA obj; // ClassB has a reference to ClassA
         // class members
     }
     ```

   - Association Example:
     ```java
     class Car {
         Engine engine; // Car has an Engine
         // car-related members
     }

     class Engine {
         // engine-related members
     }
     ```

   - In the example above, the `Car` class has a reference to the `Engine` class, indicating a "HAS-A" relationship between them.

   - Association allows classes to be connected and collaborate by using instances of other classes as instance variables.

It's important to note that inheritance and association are different concepts, but they can be used together to model complex relationships between classes and achieve code reusability and maintainability.

# `@Autowired` in Spring

The `@Autowired` annotation in Spring is used to automatically wire (inject) dependencies into a class. It enables the Spring container to find the required objects and establish the necessary connections with the current class object.

When `@Autowired` is applied to a field, setter method, or constructor, Spring will look for a matching bean of the required type and inject it into the annotated component. It is a way to achieve dependency injection without explicitly instantiating or looking up dependencies.

Here's a breakdown of how `@Autowired` can be used:

1. Field Injection:
   ```java
   @Autowired
   private Dependency dependency;
   ```
   In this case, Spring will search for a bean of the `Dependency` type and assign it to the `dependency` field.

2. Setter Method Injection:
   ```java
   private Dependency dependency;

   @Autowired
   public void setDependency(Dependency dependency) {
       this.dependency = dependency;
   }
   ```
   Spring will locate a bean of the `Dependency` type and invoke the `setDependency` method, passing the found dependency as an argument.

3. Constructor Injection:
   ```java
   private Dependency dependency;

   @Autowired
   public MyClass(Dependency dependency) {
       this.dependency = dependency;
   }
   ```
   Here, Spring will look for a bean of the `Dependency` type and use it to instantiate `MyClass`, providing the dependency via the constructor.

By default, `@Autowired` performs a type-based autowiring. However, you can further specify the dependency resolution behavior by combining it with other annotations like `@Qualifier` or `@Primary`.

It's important to note that in order to use `@Autowired`, you need to enable component scanning in your Spring configuration and annotate the dependencies (beans) with appropriate stereotypes like `@Component`, `@Service`, or `@Repository` so that Spring can identify and manage them.

Overall, `@Autowired` simplifies the process of dependency injection in Spring by letting the container handle the wiring of dependencies, promoting loose coupling and making your code more modular and flexible.

<br/>
<br/>

# Let's go through the example you provided step by step:

1. Spring Beans:
   ```java
   package com.app.repo;

   import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
   import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

   @Component
   public class MyRepository {
	   
       @Value("SAMPLE")
       private String entity;

       @Override
       public String toString() {
           return "MyRepository [entity=" + entity + "]";
       }
   }
   ```
   In this example, `MyRepository` is a Spring bean annotated with `@Component`. It has a field named `entity` that is annotated with `@Value`. This annotation sets the value of `entity` to "SAMPLE". This class represents a repository component in the application.

2. Spring Beans:
   ```java
   package com.app.serv;

   import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
   import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

   import com.app.repo.MyRepository;

   @Component
   public class MyService {
	   
       @Autowired
       private MyRepository repo; //HAS-A

       @Override
       public String toString() {
           return "MyService [repo=" + repo + "]";
       }
   }
   ```
   The `MyService` class is another Spring bean annotated with `@Component`. It has a field named `repo` of type `MyRepository`. This field is annotated with `@Autowired`, which tells Spring to inject an instance of `MyRepository` into the `repo` field. This class represents a service component that depends on the `MyRepository` component.

3. Spring Config File:
   ```java
   package com.app.config;

   import org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan;

   @ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.app")
   public class MyAppConfig {
   }
   ```
   The `MyAppConfig` class is the Spring configuration class. It is annotated with `@ComponentScan`, specifying the base package as "com.app". This allows Spring to scan for components within this package and its sub-packages.

4. Test class:
   ```java
   package com.app.test;

   import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
   import org.springframework.context.annotation.AnnotationConfigApplicationContext;

   import com.app.config.MyAppConfig;

   public class MyTest {
	   
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           ApplicationContext ac = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(MyAppConfig.class);
           Object ob = ac.getBean("myService");
           System.out.println(ob);
       }
   }
   ```
   In the `MyTest` class, an `ApplicationContext` is created using the `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` and the `MyAppConfig` class is passed as an argument. Then, the `myService` bean is retrieved from the context using `ac.getBean("myService")`. Finally, the `toString()` method of the `myService` object is called and printed to the console.

When you run the `MyTest` class, Spring will scan for components in the "com.app" package and its sub-packages. It will instantiate the `MyRepository` and `MyService` beans and automatically wire the `MyRepository` instance into the `MyService` instance using the `@Autowired` annotation. The output will be the result of calling `toString()` on the `myService` object, which includes the injected `repo` dependency.

Overall, this example demonstrates the use of `@Autowired` to automatically inject dependencies between Spring beans. By using the `@Component` annotation and component scanning, Spring can discover and manage the beans, making it easier to wire them together and build a modular and flexible application.
